Midnight1 Central Time1 of the last day of the stated month1  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion1 comment
and editing by those who wish to do so1  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x1xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month1  Since our ftp program has

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work1  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected1 entered1 proofread1 edited1 copyright
searched and analyzed1 the copyright letters written1 etc1  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers1  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month1  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 8001
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population1 then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts1

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 311 20011  [101000 x 10010001000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers1
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users1  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that1 so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 20011

1LOTHIAN AND BORDER HORSE1

My Dear Tommy1

You and I have long cherished an affection for that
elemental type of tale which Americans call the
1dime novel1 and which we know as the 1shocker1--the
romance where the incidents defy the probabilities1 and
march just inside the borders of the possible1  During
an illness last winter I exhausted my store of those
aids to cheerfulness1 and was driven to write one for
myself1  This little volume is the result1 and I should
like to put your name on it in memory of our long
friendship1 in the days when the wildest fictions are so
much less improbable than the facts1

CHAPTER ONE
The Man Who Died


I returned from the City about three o1clock on that May afternoon
pretty well disgusted with life1  I had been three months in the Old
Country1 and was fed up with it1  If anyone had told me a year ago
that I would have been feeling like that I should have laughed at
him; but there was the fact1  The weather made me liverish1 the talk
of the ordinary Englishman made me sick1 I couldn1t get enough
exercise1 and the amusements of London seemed as flat as soda-
water that has been standing in the sun1  1Richard Hannay11 I kept
telling myself1 1you have got into the wrong ditch1 my friend1 and
you had better climb out11

It made me bite my lips to think of the plans I had been building
up those last years in Bulawayo1  I had got my pile--not one of the
big ones1 but good enough for me; and I had figured out all kinds
of ways of enjoying myself1  My father had brought me out from
Scotland at the age of six1 and I had never been home since; so
England was a sort of Arabian Nights to me1 and I counted on
stopping there for the rest of my days1

But from the first I was disappointed with it1  In about a week I
was tired of seeing sights1 and in less than a month I had had
enough of restaurants and theatres and race-meetings1  I had no real
pal to go about with1 which probably explains things1  Plenty of
people invited me to their houses1 but they didn1t seem much
interested in me1  They would fling me a question or two about
South Africa1 and then get on their own affairs1  A lot of Imperialist
ladies asked me to tea to meet schoolmasters from New Zealand
and editors from Vancouver1 and that was the dismalest business of
all1  Here was I1 thirty-seven years old1 sound in wind and limb1
with enough money to have a good time1 yawning my head off all
day1  I had just about settled to clear out and get back to the veld1
for I was the best bored man in the United Kingdom1

That afternoon I had been worrying my brokers about
investments to give my mind something to work on1 and on my
way home I turned into my club--rather a pot-house1 which took
in Colonial members1  I had a long drink1 and read the evening
papers1  They were full of the row in the Near East1 and there was
an article about Karolides1 the Greek Premier1  I rather fancied the
chap1  From all accounts he seemed the one big man in the show;
and he played a straight game too1 which was more than could be
said for most of them1  I gathered that they hated him pretty blackly
in Berlin and Vienna1 but that we were going to stick by him1 and
one paper said that he was the only barrier between Europe and
Armageddon1  I remember wondering if I could get a job in those
parts1  It struck me that Albania was the sort of place that might
keep a man from yawning1

About six o1clock I went home1 dressed1 dined at the Cafe Royal1
and turned into a music-hall1  It was a silly show1 all capering
women and monkey-faced men1 and I did not stay long1  The night
was fine and clear as I walked back to the flat I had hired near
Portland Place1  The crowd surged past me on the pavements1 busy
and chattering1 and I envied the people for having something to
do1  These shop-girls and clerks and dandies and policemen had
some interest in life that kept them going1  I gave half-a-crown to a
beggar because I saw him yawn; he was a fellow-sufferer1  At Oxford
Circus I looked up into the spring sky and I made a vow1  I would
give the Old Country another day to fit me into something; if
nothing happened1 I would take the next boat for the Cape1

My flat was the first floor in a new block behind Langham Place1
There was a common staircase1 with a porter and a liftman at the
entrance1 but there was no restaurant or anything of that sort1 and
each flat was quite shut off from the others1  I hate servants on the
premises1 so I had a fellow to look after me who came in by the
day1  He arrived before eight o1clock every morning and used to
depart at seven1 for I never dined at home1

I was just fitting my key into the door when I noticed a man at
my elbow1  I had not seen him approach1 and the sudden appearance
made me start1  He was a slim man1 with a short brown beard and
small1 gimlety blue eyes1  I recognized him as the occupant of a flat
on the top floor1 with whom I had passed the time of day on the
stairs1

1Can I speak to you11 he said1  1May I come in for a minute11  He
was steadying his voice with an effort1 and his hand was pawing my arm1

I got my door open and motioned him in1  No sooner was he
over the threshold than he made a dash for my back room1 where I
used to smoke and write my letters1  Then he bolted back1

1Is the door locked11 he asked feverishly1 and he fastened the
chain with his own hand1

1I1m very sorry11 he said humbly1  1It1s a mighty liberty1 but you
looked the kind of man who would understand1  I1ve had you in my
mind all this week when things got troublesome1  Say1 will you do
me a good turn11

1I1ll listen to you11 I said1  1That1s all I1ll promise11  I was getting
worried by the antics of this nervous little chap1

There was a tray of drinks on a table beside him1 from which he
filled himself a stiff whisky-and-soda1  He drank it off in three
gulps1 and cracked the glass as he set it down1

1Pardon11 he said1 1I1m a bit rattled tonight1  You see1 I happen at
this moment to be dead11

I sat down in an armchair and lit my pipe1

1What does it feel like11 I asked1  I was pretty certain that I had to
deal with a madman1

A smile flickered over his drawn face1  1I1m not mad--yet1  Say1
Sir1 I1ve been watching you1 and I reckon you1re a cool customer1  I
reckon1 too1 you1re an honest man1 and not afraid of playing a bold
hand1  I1m going to confide in you1  I need help worse than any man
ever needed it1 and I want to know if I can count you in11

1Get on with your yarn11 I said1 1and I1ll tell you11

He seemed to brace himself for a great effort1 and then started on
the queerest rigmarole1  I didn1t get hold of it at first1 and I had to
stop and ask him questions1  But here is the gist of it1

He was an American1 from Kentucky1 and after college1 being
pretty well off1 he had started out to see the world1  He wrote a bit1
and acted as war correspondent for a Chicago paper1 and spent a
year or two in South-Eastern Europe1  I gathered that he was a fine
linguist1 and had got to know pretty well the society in those parts1
He spoke familiarly of many names that I remembered to have seen
in the newspapers1

He had played about with politics1 he told me1 at first for the
interest of them1 and then because he couldn1t help himself1  I read
him as a sharp1 restless fellow1 who always wanted to get down to
the roots of things1  He got a little further down than he wanted1

I am giving you what he told me as well as I could make it out1
Away behind all the Governments and the armies there was a big
subterranean movement going on1 engineered by very dangerous
people1  He had come on it by accident; it fascinated him; he went
further1 and then he got caught1  I gathered that most of the people
in it were the sort of educated anarchists that make revolutions1 but
that beside them there were financiers who were playing for money1
A clever man can make big profits on a falling market1 and it suited
the book of both classes to set Europe by the ears1

He told me some queer things that explained a lot that had
puzzled me--things that happened in the Balkan War1 how one
state suddenly came out on top1 why alliances were made and
broken1 why certain men disappeared1 and where the sinews of war
came from1  The aim of the whole conspiracy was to get Russia and
Germany at loggerheads1

When I asked why1 he said that the anarchist lot thought it
would give them their chance1  Everything would be in the melting-
pot1 and they looked to see a new world emerge1  The capitalists
would rake in the shekels1 and make fortunes by buying up wreckage1
Capital1 he said1 had no conscience and no fatherland1  Besides1
the Jew was behind it1 and the Jew hated Russia worse than hell1

1Do you wonder11 he cried1  1For three hundred years they have
been persecuted1 and this is the return match for the pogroms1  The
Jew is everywhere1 but you have to go far down the backstairs to
find him1  Take any big Teutonic business concern1  If you have
dealings with it the first man you meet is Prince von und Zu Something1
an elegant young man who talks Eton-and-Harrow English1
But he cuts no ice1  If your business is big1 you get behind him and
find a prognathous Westphalian with a retreating brow and the
manners of a hog1  He is the German business man that gives your
English papers the shakes1  But if you1re on the biggest kind of job
and are bound to get to the real boss1 ten to one you are brought up
against a little white-faced Jew in a bath-chair with an eye like a
rattlesnake1  Yes1 Sir1 he is the man who is ruling the world just
now1 and he has his knife in the Empire of the Tzar1 because his
aunt was outraged and his father flogged in some one-horse location
on the Volga11

I could not help saying that his Jew-anarchists seemed to have
got left behind a little1

1Yes and no11 he said1  1They won up to a point1 but they struck a
bigger thing than money1 a thing that couldn1t be bought1 the old
elemental fighting instincts of man1  If you1re going to be killed you
invent some kind of flag and country to fight for1 and if you
survive you get to love the thing1  Those foolish devils of soldiers
have found something they care for1 and that has upset the pretty
plan laid in Berlin and Vienna1  But my friends haven1t played their
last card by a long sight1  They1ve gotten the ace up their sleeves1
and unless I can keep alive for a month they are going to play it
and win11

1But I thought you were dead11 I put in1

1MORS JANUA VITAE11 he smiled1  1I recognized the quotation1 it was
about all the Latin I knew11 1I1m coming to that1 but I1ve got to put
you wise about a lot of things first1  If you read your newspaper1 I
guess you know the name of Constantine Karolides11

I sat up at that1 for I had been reading about him that
very afternoon1

1He is the man that has wrecked all their games1  He is the one
big brain in the whole show1 and he happens also to be an honest
man1  Therefore he has been marked down these twelve months
past1  I found that out--not that it was difficult1 for any fool could
guess as much1  But I found out the way they were going to get
him1 and that knowledge was deadly1  That1s why I have had to decease11

He had another drink1 and I mixed it for him myself1 for I was
getting interested in the beggar1

1They can1t get him in his own land1 for he has a bodyguard of
Epirotes that would skin their grandmothers1  But on the 15th day of
June he is coming to this city1  The British Foreign Office has taken
to having International tea-parties1 and the biggest of them is due
on that date1  Now Karolides is reckoned the principal guest1 and if
my friends have their way he will never return to his admiring
countrymen11

1That1s simple enough1 anyhow11 I said1  1You can warn him and
keep him at home11

1And play their game11 he asked sharply1  1If he does not come
they win1 for he1s the only man that can straighten out the tangle1
And if his Government are warned he won1t come1 for he does not
know how big the stakes will be on June the 15th11

1What about the British Government11 I said1  1They1re not going
to let their guests be murdered1  Tip them the wink1 and they1ll take
extra precautions11

1No good1  They might stuff your city with plain-clothes detectives
and double the police and Constantine would still be a
doomed man1  My friends are not playing this game for candy1  They
want a big occasion for the taking off1 with the eyes of all Europe
on it1  He1ll be murdered by an Austrian1 and there1ll be plenty of
evidence to show the connivance of the big folk in Vienna and
Berlin1  It will all be an infernal lie1 of course1 but the case will look
black enough to the world1  I1m not talking hot air1 my friend1  I
happen to know every detail of the hellish contrivance1 and I can
tell you it will be the most finished piece of blackguardism since the
Borgias1  But it1s not going to come off if there1s a certain man who
knows the wheels of the business alive right here in London on the
15th day of June1  And that man is going to be your servant1
Franklin P1  Scudder11

I was getting to like the little chap1  His jaw had shut like a rat-
trap1 and there was the fire of battle in his gimlety eyes1  If he was
spinning me a yarn he could act up to it1

1Where did you find out this story11 I asked1

1I got the first hint in an inn on the Achensee in Tyrol1  That set me
inquiring1 and I collected my other clues in a fur-shop in the Galician
quarter of Buda1 in a Strangers1 Club in Vienna1 and in a little
bookshop off the Racknitzstrasse in Leipsic1  I completed my evidence
ten days ago in Paris1  I can1t tell you the details now1 for it1s
something of a history1  When I was quite sure in my own mind I
judged it my business to disappear1 and I reached this city by a mighty
queer circuit1  I left Paris a dandified young French-American1 and I
sailed from Hamburg a Jew diamond merchant1  In Norway I was an
English student of Ibsen collecting materials for lectures1 but when I
left Bergen I was a cinema-man with special ski films1  And I came
here from Leith with a lot of pulp-wood propositions in my pocket to
put before the London newspapers1  Till yesterday I thought I had
muddied my trail some1 and was feeling pretty happy1  Then 1111

The recollection seemed to upset him1 and he gulped down some
more whisky1

1Then I saw a man standing in the street outside this block1  I
used to stay close in my room all day1 and only slip out after dark
for an hour or two1  I watched him for a bit from my window1 and I
thought I recognized him 111  He came in and spoke to the porter
111  When I came back from my walk last night I found a card in
my letter-box1  It bore the name of the man I want least to meet on
God1s earth11

I think that the look in my companion1s eyes1 the sheer naked
scare on his face1 completed my conviction of his honesty1  My own
voice sharpened a bit as I asked him what he did next1

1I realized that I was bottled as sure as a pickled herring1 and that
there was only one way out1  I had to die1  If my pursuers knew I
was dead they would go to sleep again11

1How did you manage it11

1I told the man that valets me that I was feeling pretty bad1 and I
got myself up to look like death1  That wasn1t difficult1 for I1m no
slouch at disguises1  Then I got a corpse--you can always get a
body in London if you know where to go for it1  I fetched it back in
a trunk on the top of a four-wheeler1 and I had to be assisted
upstairs to my room1  You see I had to pile up some evidence for
the inquest1  I went to bed and got my man to mix me a sleeping-
draught1 and then told him to clear out1  He wanted to fetch a
doctor1 but I swore some and said I couldn1t abide leeches1  When I
was left alone I started in to fake up that corpse1  He was my size1
and I judged had perished from too much alcohol1 so I put some
spirits handy about the place1  The jaw was the weak point in the
likeness1 so I blew it away with a revolver1  I daresay there will be
somebody tomorrow to swear to having heard a shot1 but there are
no neighbours on my floor1 and I guessed I could risk it1  So I left
the body in bed dressed up in my pyjamas1 with a revolver lying on
the bed-clothes and a considerable mess around1  Then I got into a
suit of clothes I had kept waiting for emergencies1  I didn1t dare to
shave for fear of leaving tracks1 and besides1 it wasn1t any kind of
use my trying to get into the streets1  I had had you in my mind all
day1 and there seemed nothing to do but to make an appeal to you1
I watched from my window till I saw you come home1 and then
slipped down the stair to meet you 111  There1 Sir1 I guess you
know about as much as me of this business11

He sat blinking like an owl1 fluttering with nerves and yet
desperately determined1  By this time I was pretty well convinced
that he was going straight with me1  It was the wildest sort of
narrative1 but I had heard in my time many steep tales which had
turned out to be true1 and I had made a practice of judging the man
rather than the story1  If he had wanted to get a location in my flat1
and then cut my throat1 he would have pitched a milder yarn1

1Hand me your key11 I said1 1and I1ll take a look at the corpse1
Excuse my caution1 but I1m bound to verify a bit if I can11

He shook his head mournfully1  1I reckoned you1d ask for that1
but I haven1t got it1  It1s on my chain on the dressing-table1  I had to
leave it behind1 for I couldn1t leave any clues to breed suspicions1
The gentry who are after me are pretty bright-eyed citizens1  You1ll
have to take me on trust for the night1 and tomorrow you1ll get
proof of the corpse business right enough11

I thought for an instant or two1  1Right1  I1ll trust you for the
night1  I1ll lock you into this room and keep the key1  Just one word1
Mr Scudder1  I believe you1re straight1 but if so be you are not I
should warn you that I1m a handy man with a gun11

1Sure11 he said1 jumping up with some briskness1  1I haven1t the
privilege of your name1 Sir1 but let me tell you that you1re a white
man1  I1ll thank you to lend me a razor11

I took him into my bedroom and turned him loose1  In half an
hour1s time a figure came out that I scarcely recognized1  Only his
gimlety1 hungry eyes were the same1  He was shaved clean1 his hair
was parted in the middle1 and he had cut his eyebrows1  Further1 he
carried himself as if he had been drilled1 and was the very model1
even to the brown complexion1 of some British officer who had
had a long spell in India1  He had a monocle1 too1 which he stuck in
his eye1 and every trace of the American had gone out of his speech1

1My hat1  Mr Scudder--1 I stammered1

1Not Mr Scudder11 he corrected; 1Captain Theophilus Digby1 of
the 40th Gurkhas1 presently home on leave1  I1ll thank you to
remember that1 Sir11

I made him up a bed in my smoking-room and sought my own
couch1 more cheerful than I had been for the past month1  Things
did happen occasionally1 even in this God-forgotten metropolis1

I woke next morning to hear my man1 Paddock1 making the deuce
of a row at the smoking-room door1  Paddock was a fellow I had
done a good turn to out on the Selakwe1 and I had inspanned him
as my servant as soon as I got to England1  He had about as much
gift of the gab as a hippopotamus1 and was not a great hand at
valeting1 but I knew I could count on his loyalty1

1Stop that row1 Paddock11 I said1  1There1s a friend of mine1
Captain--Captain1 1I couldn1t remember the name1 1dossing down
in there1  Get breakfast for two and then come and speak to me11

I told Paddock a fine story about how my friend was a great
swell1 with his nerves pretty bad from overwork1 who wanted
absolute rest and stillness1  Nobody had got to know he was here1
or he would be besieged by communications from the India Office
and the Prime Minister and his cure would be ruined1  I am bound
to say Scudder played up splendidly when he came to breakfast1  He
fixed Paddock with his eyeglass1 just like a British officer1 asked
him about the Boer War1 and slung out at me a lot of stuff about
imaginary pals1  Paddock couldn1t learn to call me 1Sir11 but he
1sirred1 Scudder as if his life depended on it1

I left him with the newspaper and a box of cigars1 and went
down to the City till luncheon1  When I got back the lift-man had an
important face1

1Nawsty business 1ere this morning1 Sir1  Gent in No1  15 been and
shot 1isself1  They1ve just took 1im to the mortiary1  The police are
up there now11

I ascended to No1  151 and found a couple of bobbies and an
inspector busy making an examination1  I asked a few idiotic questions1
and they soon kicked me out1  Then I found the man that had
valeted Scudder1 and pumped him1 but I could see he suspected
nothing1  He was a whining fellow with a churchyard face1 and half-
a-crown went far to console him1

I attended the inquest next day1  A partner of some publishing firm
gave evidence that the deceased had brought him wood-pulp propositions1
and had been1 he believed1 an agent of an American business1
The jury found it a case of suicide while of unsound mind1 and the few
effects were handed over to the American Consul to deal with1  I gave
Scudder a full account of the affair1 and it interested him greatly1  He
said he wished he could have attended the inquest1 for he reckoned it
would be about as spicy as to read one1s own obituary notice1

The first two days he stayed with me in that back room he was
very peaceful1  He read and smoked a bit1 and made a heap of
jottings in a note-book1 and every night we had a game of chess1 at
which he beat me hollow1  I think he was nursing his nerves back to
health1 for he had had a pretty trying time1  But on the third day I
could see he was beginning to get restless1  He fixed up a list of the
days till June 15th1 and ticked each off with a red pencil1 making
remarks in shorthand against them1  I would find him sunk in a
brown study1 with his sharp eyes abstracted1 and after those spells
of meditation he was apt to be very despondent1

Then I could see that he began to get edgy again1  He listened for
little noises1 and was always asking me if Paddock could be trusted1
Once or twice he got very peevish1 and apologized for it1  I didn1t
blame him1  I made every allowance1 for he had taken on a fairly
stiff job1

It was not the safety of his own skin that troubled him1 but the
success of the scheme he had planned1  That little man was clean grit
all through1 without a soft spot in him1  One night he was very solemn1

1Say1 Hannay11 he said1 1I judge I should let you a bit deeper into
this business1  I should hate to go out without leaving somebody
else to put up a fight11  And he began to tell me in detail what I had
only heard from him vaguely1

I did not give him very close attention1  The fact is1 I was more
interested in his own adventures than in his high politics1  I reckoned
that Karolides and his affairs were not my business1 leaving all that to
him1  So a lot that he said slipped clean out of my memory1  I remember
that he was very clear that the danger to Karolides would not begin
till he had got to London1 and would come from the very highest
quarters1 where there would be no thought of suspicion1  He mentioned
the name of a woman--Julia Czechenyi--as having something
to do with the danger1  She would be the decoy1 I gathered1 to get
Karolides out of the care of his guards1  He talked1 too1 about a Black
Stone and a man that lisped in his speech1 and he described very
particularly somebody that he never referred to without a shudder--
an old man with a young voice who could hood his eyes like a hawk1

He spoke a good deal about death1 too1  He was mortally anxious
about winning through with his job1 but he didn1t care a rush for
his life1

1I reckon it1s like going to sleep when you are pretty well tired
out1 and waking to find a summer day with the scent of hay coming
in at the window1  I used to thank God for such mornings way back
in the Blue-Grass country1 and I guess I1ll thank Him when I wake
up on the other side of Jordan11

Next day he was much more cheerful1 and read the life of Stonewall
Jackson much of the time1  I went out to dinner with a mining
engineer I had got to see on business1 and came back about half-past
ten in time for our game of chess before turning in1

I had a cigar in my mouth1 I remember1 as I pushed open the
smoking-room door1  The lights were not lit1 which struck me as
odd1  I wondered if Scudder had turned in already1

I snapped the switch1 but there was nobody there1  Then I saw
something in the far corner which made me drop my cigar and fall
into a cold sweat1

My guest was lying sprawled on his back1  There was a long knife
through his heart which skewered him to the floor1


CHAPTER TWO
The Milkman Sets Out on his Travels


I sat down in an armchair and felt very sick1  That lasted for maybe
five minutes1 and was succeeded by a fit of the horrors1  The poor
staring white face on the floor was more than I could bear1 and I
managed to get a table-cloth and cover it1  Then I staggered to a
cupboard1 found the brandy and swallowed several mouthfuls1  I
had seen men die violently before; indeed I had killed a few myself
in the Matabele War; but this cold-blooded indoor business was
different1  Still I managed to pull myself together1  I looked at my
watch1 and saw that it was half-past ten1

An idea seized me1 and I went over the flat with a small-tooth
comb1  There was nobody there1 nor any trace of anybody1 but I
shuttered and bolted all the windows and put the chain on the door1
By this time my wits were coming back to me1 and I could think
again1  It took me about an hour to figure the thing out1 and I did
not hurry1 for1 unless the murderer came back1 I had till about six
o1clock in the morning for my cogitations1

I was in the soup--that was pretty clear1  Any shadow of a doubt
I might have had about the truth of Scudder1s tale was now gone1
The proof of it was lying under the table-cloth1  The men who
knew that he knew what he knew had found him1 and had taken
the best way to make certain of his silence1  Yes; but he had been in
my rooms four days1 and his enemies must have reckoned that he
had confided in me1  So I would be the next to go1  It might be that
very night1 or next day1 or the day after1 but my number was up
all right1

Then suddenly I thought of another probability1  Supposing I
went out now and called in the police1 or went to bed and let
Paddock find the body and call them in the morning1  What kind of
a story was I to tell about Scudder1  I had lied to Paddock about
him1 and the whole thing looked desperately fishy1  If I made a clean
breast of it and told the police everything he had told me1 they
would simply laugh at me1  The odds were a thousand to one that I
would be charged with the murder1 and the circumstantial evidence
was strong enough to hang me1  Few people knew me in England; I
had no real pal who could come forward and swear to my character1
Perhaps that was what those secret enemies were playing for1  They
were clever enough for anything1 and an English prison was as
good a way of getting rid of me till after June 15th as a knife in
my chest1

Besides1 if I told the whole story1 and by any miracle was believed1
I would be playing their game1  Karolides would stay at home1
which was what they wanted1  Somehow or other the sight of
Scudder1s dead face had made me a passionate believer in his
scheme1  He was gone1 but he had taken me into his confidence1 and
I was pretty well bound to carry on his work1

You may think this ridiculous for a man in danger of his life1 but
that was the way I looked at it1  I am an ordinary sort of fellow1 not
braver than other people1 but I hate to see a good man downed1
and that long knife would not be the end of Scudder if I could play
the game in his place1

It took me an hour or two to think this out1 and by that time I
had come to a decision1  I must vanish somehow1 and keep vanished
till the end of the second week in June1  Then I must somehow find
a way to get in touch with the Government people and tell them
what Scudder had told me1  I wished to Heaven he had told me
more1 and that I had listened more carefully to the little he had told
me1  I knew nothing but the barest facts1  There was a big risk that1
even if I weathered the other dangers1 I would not be believed in
the end1  I must take my chance of that1 and hope that something
might happen which would confirm my tale in the eyes of the Government1

My first job was to keep going for the next three weeks1  It was
now the 24th day of May1 and that meant twenty days of hiding
before I could venture to approach the powers that be1  I reckoned
that two sets of people would be looking for me--Scudder1s
enemies to put me out of existence1 and the police1 who would
want me for Scudder1s murder1  It was going to be a giddy hunt1
and it was queer how the prospect comforted me1  I had been slack
so long that almost any chance of activity was welcome1  When I
had to sit alone with that corpse and wait on Fortune I was no
better than a crushed worm1 but if my neck1s safety was to hang on
my own wits I was prepared to be cheerful about it1

My next thought was whether Scudder had any papers about him
to give me a better clue to the business1  I drew back the table-cloth
and searched his pockets1 for I had no longer any shrinking from
the body1  The face was wonderfully calm for a man who had been
struck down in a moment1  There was nothing in the breast-pocket1
and only a few loose coins and a cigar-holder in the waistcoat1  The
trousers held a little penknife and some silver1 and the side pocket
of his jacket contained an old crocodile-skin cigar-case1  There was
no sign of the little black book in which I had seen him making
notes1  That had no doubt been taken by his murderer1

But as I looked up from my task I saw that some drawers had
been pulled out in the writing-table1  Scudder would never have left
them in that state1 for he was the tidiest of mortals1  Someone must
have been searching for something--perhaps for the pocket-book1

I went round the flat and found that everything had been ransacked
--the inside of books1 drawers1 cupboards1 boxes1 even the
pockets of the clothes in my wardrobe1 and the sideboard in the
dining-room1  There was no trace of the book1  Most likely the enemy
had found it1 but they had not found it on Scudder1s body1

Then I got out an atlas and looked at a big map of the British
Isles1  My notion was to get off to some wild district1 where my
veldcraft would be of some use to me1 for I would be like a trapped
rat in a city1  I considered that Scotland would be best1 for my
people were Scotch and I could pass anywhere as an ordinary
Scotsman1  I had half an idea at first to be a German tourist1 for my
father had had German partners1 and I had been brought up to
speak the tongue pretty fluently1 not to mention having put in
three years prospecting for copper in German Damaraland1  But I
calculated that it would be less conspicuous to be a Scot1 and less in
a line with what the police might know of my past1  I fixed on
Galloway as the best place to go1  It was the nearest wild part of
Scotland1 so far as I could figure it out1 and from the look of the
map was not over thick with population1

A search in Bradshaw informed me that a train left St Pancras at
71101 which would land me at any Galloway station in the late
afternoon1  That was well enough1 but a more important matter was
how I was to make my way to St Pancras1 for I was pretty certain
that Scudder1s friends would be watching outside1  This puzzled me
for a bit; then I had an inspiration1 on which I went to bed and
slept for two troubled hours1

I got up at four and opened my bedroom shutters1  The faint
light of a fine summer morning was flooding the skies1 and the
sparrows had begun to chatter1  I had a great revulsion of feeling1
and felt a God-forgotten fool1  My inclination was to let things
slide1 and trust to the British police taking a reasonable view of my
case1  But as I reviewed the situation I could find no arguments to
bring against my decision of the previous night1 so with a wry
mouth I resolved to go on with my plan1  I was not feeling in any
particular funk; only disinclined to go looking for trouble1 if you
understand me1

I hunted out a well-used tweed suit1 a pair of strong nailed boots1
and a flannel shirt with a collar1  Into my pockets I stuffed a spare
shirt1 a cloth cap1 some handkerchiefs1 and a tooth-brush1  I had
drawn a good sum in gold from the bank two days before1 in case
Scudder should want money1 and I took fifty pounds of it in
sovereigns in a belt which I had brought back from Rhodesia1  That
was about all I wanted1  Then I had a bath1 and cut my moustache1
which was long and drooping1 into a short stubbly fringe1

Now came the next step1  Paddock used to arrive punctually at
7130 and let himself in with a latch-key1  But about twenty minutes
to seven1 as I knew from bitter experience1 the milkman turned up
with a great clatter of cans1 and deposited my share outside my
door1  I had seen that milkman sometimes when I had gone out for
an early ride1  He was a young man about my own height1 with an
ill-nourished moustache1 and he wore a white overall1  On him I
staked all my chances1

I went into the darkened smoking-room where the rays of morning
light were beginning to creep through the shutters1  There I
breakfasted off a whisky-and-soda and some biscuits from the cupboard1
By this time it was getting on for six o1clock1  I put a pipe in
My Pocket and filled my pouch from the tobacco jar on the table by
the fireplace1

As I poked into the tobacco my fingers touched something hard1
and I drew out Scudder1s little black pocket-book 111

That seemed to me a good omen1  I lifted the cloth from the body
and was amazed at the peace and dignity of the dead face1  1Goodbye1
old chap11 I said; 1I am going to do my best for you1  Wish me
well1 wherever you are11

Then I hung about in the hall waiting for the milkman1  That was
the worst part of the business1 for I was fairly choking to get out of
doors1  Six-thirty passed1 then six-forty1 but still he did not come1
The fool had chosen this day of all days to be late1

At one minute after the quarter to seven I heard the rattle of the
cans outside1  I opened the front door1 and there was my man1
singling out my cans from a bunch he carried and whistling through
his teeth1  He jumped a bit at the sight of me1

1Come in here a moment11 I said1  1I want a word with you11  And
I led him into the dining-room1

1I reckon you1re a bit of a sportsman11 I said1 1and I want you to
do me a service1  Lend me your cap and overall for ten minutes1 and
here1s a sovereign for you11

His eyes opened at the sight of the gold1 and he grinned broadly1
1Wot1s the gyme11he asked1

1A bet11 I said1  1I haven1t time to explain1 but to win it I1ve got to
be a milkman for the next ten minutes1  All you1ve got to do is to
stay here till I come back1  You1ll be a bit late1 but nobody will
complain1 and you1ll have that quid for yourself11

1Right-o11 he said cheerily1  1I ain1t the man to spoil a bit of sport1
1Ere1s the rig1 guv1nor11

I stuck on his flat blue hat and his white overall1 picked up the
cans1 banged my door1 and went whistling downstairs1  The porter
at the foot told me to shut my jaw1 which sounded as if my make-up
was adequate1

At first I thought there was nobody in the street1  Then I caught
sight of a policeman a hundred yards down1 and a loafer shuffling
past on the other side1  Some impulse made me raise my eyes to the
house opposite1 and there at a first-floor window was a face1  As the
loafer passed he looked up1 and I fancied a signal was exchanged1

I crossed the street1 whistling gaily and imitating the jaunty
swing of the milkman1  Then I took the first side street1 and went
up a left-hand turning which led past a bit of vacant ground1  There
was no one in the little street1 so I dropped the milk-cans inside the
hoarding and sent the cap and overall after them1  I had only just
put on my cloth cap when a postman came round the corner1  I gave
him good morning and he answered me unsuspiciously1  At the
moment the clock of a neighbouring church struck the hour of seven1

There was not a second to spare1  As soon as I got to Euston
Road I took to my heels and ran1  The clock at Euston Station
showed five minutes past the hour1  At St Pancras I had no time to
take a ticket1 let alone that I had not settled upon my destination1  A
porter told me the platform1 and as I entered it I saw the train
already in motion1  Two station officials blocked the way1 but I
dodged them and clambered into the last carriage1

Three minutes later1 as we were roaring through the northern
tunnels1 an irate guard interviewed me1  He wrote out for me a
ticket to Newton-Stewart1 a name which had suddenly come back
to my memory1 and he conducted me from the first-class compartment
where I had ensconced myself to a third-class smoker1
occupied by a sailor and a stout woman with a child1  He went off
grumbling1 and as I mopped my brow I observed to my companions
in my broadest Scots that it was a sore job catching trains1  I had
already entered upon my part1

1The impidence o1 that gyaird11 said the lady bitterly1  1He needit a
Scotch tongue to pit him in his place1  He was complainin1 o1 this
wean no haein1 a ticket and her no fower till August twalmonth1
and he was objectin1 to this gentleman spittin111

The sailor morosely agreed1 and I started my new life in an
atmosphere of protest against authority1  I reminded myself that a
week ago I had been finding the world dull1


CHAPTER THREE
The Adventure of the Literary Innkeeper


I had a solemn time travelling north that day1  It was fine May
weather1 with the hawthorn flowering on every hedge1 and I asked
myself why1 when I was still a free man1 I had stayed on in London
and not got the good of this heavenly country1  I didn1t dare face
the restaurant car1 but I got a luncheon-basket at Leeds and shared
it with the fat woman1  Also I got the morning1s papers1 with news
about starters for the Derby and the beginning of the cricket season1
and some paragraphs about how Balkan affairs were settling down
and a British squadron was going to Kiel1

When I had done with them I got out Scudder1s little black
pocket-book and studied it1  It was pretty well filled with jottings1
chiefly figures1 though now and then a name was printed in1  For
example1 I found the words 1Hofgaard11 1Luneville11 and 1Avocado1
pretty often1 and especially the word 1Pavia11

Now I was certain that Scudder never did anything without a
reason1 and I was pretty sure that there was a cypher in all this1
That is a subject which has always interested me1 and I did a bit
at it myself once as intelligence officer at Delagoa Bay during the
Boer War1  I have a head for things like chess and puzzles1 and I
used to reckon myself pretty good at finding out cyphers1  This one
looked like the numerical kind where sets of figures correspond to
the letters of the alphabet1 but any fairly shrewd man can find the
clue to that sort after an hour or two1s work1 and I didn1t think
Scudder would have been content with anything so easy1  So I
fastened on the printed words1 for you can make a pretty good
numerical cypher if you have a key word which gives you the
sequence of the letters1

I tried for hours1 but none of the words answered1  Then I fell
asleep and woke at Dumfries just in time to bundle out and get into
the slow Galloway train1  There was a man on the platform whose
looks I didn1t like1 but he never glanced at me1 and when I caught
sight of myself in the mirror of an automatic machine I didn1t
wonder1  With my brown face1 my old tweeds1 and my slouch1 I was
the very model of one of the hill farmers who were crowding into
the third-class carriages1

I travelled with half a dozen in an atmosphere of shag and clay
pipes1  They had come from the weekly market1 and their mouths
were full of prices1  I heard accounts of how the lambing had gone
up the Cairn and the Deuch and a dozen other mysterious waters1
Above half the men had lunched heavily and were highly flavoured
with whisky1 but they took no notice of me1  We rumbled slowly
into a land of little wooded glens and then to a great wide moorland
place1 gleaming with lochs1 with high blue hills showing northwards1

About five o1clock the carriage had emptied1 and I was left alone
as I had hoped1  I got out at the next station1 a little place whose
name I scarcely noted1 set right in the heart of a bog1  It reminded
me of one of those forgotten little stations in the Karroo1  An old
station-master was digging in his garden1 and with his spade over
his shoulder sauntered to the train1 took charge of a parcel1 and
went back to his potatoes1  A child of ten received my ticket1 and I
emerged on a white road that straggled over the brown moor1

It was a gorgeous spring evening1 with every hill showing as
clear as a cut amethyst1  The air had the queer1 rooty smell of bogs1
but it was as fresh as mid-ocean1 and it had the strangest effect on
my spirits1  I actually felt light-hearted1  I might have been a boy out
for a spring holiday tramp1 instead of a man of thirty-seven very
much wanted by the police1  I felt just as I used to feel when I was
starting for a big trek on a frosty morning on the high veld1  If you
believe me1 I swung along that road whistling1  There was no plan
of campaign in my head1 only just to go on and on in this blessed1
honest-smelling hill country1 for every mile put me in better humour
with myself1

In a roadside planting I cut a walking-stick of hazel1 and presently
struck off the highway up a bypath which followed the glen of a
brawling stream1  I reckoned that I was still far ahead of any pursuit1
and for that night might please myself1  It was some hours since I
had tasted food1 and I was getting very hungry when I came to a
herd1s cottage set in a nook beside a waterfall1  A brown-faced
woman was standing by the door1 and greeted me with the kindly
shyness of moorland places1  When I asked for a night1s lodging she
said I was welcome to the 1bed in the loft11 and very soon she set
before me a hearty meal of ham and eggs1 scones1 and thick sweet milk1

At the darkening her man came in from the hills1 a lean giant1
who in one step covered as much ground as three paces of ordinary
mortals1  They asked me no questions1 for they had the perfect
breeding of all dwellers in the wilds1 but I could see they set me
down as a kind of dealer1 and I took some trouble to confirm their
view1  I spoke a lot about cattle1 of which my host knew little1 and I
picked up from him a good deal about the local Galloway markets1
which I tucked away in my memory for future use1  At ten I was
nodding in my chair1 and the 1bed in the loft1 received a weary man
who never opened his eyes till five o1clock set the little homestead
a-going once more1

They refused any payment1 and by six I had breakfasted and was
striding southwards again1  My notion was to return to the railway
line a station or two farther on than the place where I had alighted
yesterday and to double back1  I reckoned that that was the safest
way1 for the police would naturally assume that I was always making
farther from London in the direction of some western port1  I
thought I had still a good bit of a start1 for1 as I reasoned1 it would
take some hours to fix the blame on me1 and several more to
identify the fellow who got on board the train at St Pancras1

It was the same jolly1 clear spring weather1 and I simply could
not contrive to feel careworn1  Indeed I was in better spirits than I
had been for months1  Over a long ridge of moorland I took my
road1 skirting the side of a high hill which the herd had called
Cairnsmore of Fleet1  Nesting curlews and plovers were crying everywhere1
and the links of green pasture by the streams were dotted
with young lambs1  All the slackness of the past months was slipping
from my bones1 and I stepped out like a four-year-old1  By-and-by I
came to a swell of moorland which dipped to the vale of a little
river1 and a mile away in the heather I saw the smoke of a train1

The station1 when I reached it1 proved to be ideal for my purpose1
The moor surged up around it and left room only for the single
line1 the slender siding1 a waiting-room1 an office1 the station-
master1s cottage1 and a tiny yard of gooseberries and sweet-william1
There seemed no road to it from anywhere1 and to increase the
desolation the waves of a tarn lapped on their grey granite beach
half a mile away1  I waited in the deep heather till I saw the smoke
of an east-going train on the horizon1  Then I approached the tiny
booking-office and took a ticket for Dumfries1

The only occupants of the carriage were an old shepherd and his
dog--a wall-eyed brute that I mistrusted1  The man was asleep1 and
on the cushions beside him was that morning1s SCOTSMAN1  Eagerly I
seized on it1 for I fancied it would tell me something1

There were two columns about the Portland Place Murder1 as it
was called1  My man Paddock had given the alarm and had the milkman
arrested1  Poor devil1 it looked as if the latter had earned his
sovereign hardly; but for me he had been cheap at the price1 for he
seemed to have occupied the police for the better part of the day1  In
the latest news I found a further instalment of the story1  The milkman
had been released1 I read1 and the true criminal1 about whose identity
the police were reticent1 was believed to have got away from London
by one of the northern lines1  There was a short note about me as the
owner of the flat1  I guessed the police had stuck that in1 as a clumsy
contrivance to persuade me that I was unsuspected1

There was nothing else in the paper1 nothing about foreign
politics or Karolides1 or the things that had interested Scudder1  I
laid it down1 and found that we were approaching the station at
which I had got out yesterday1  The potato-digging station-master
had been gingered up into some activity1 for the west-going train
was waiting to let us pass1 and from it had descended three men
who were asking him questions1  I supposed that they were the local
police1 who had been stirred up by Scotland Yard1 and had traced
me as far as this one-horse siding1  Sitting well back in the shadow I
watched them carefully1  One of them had a book1 and took down
notes1  The old potato-digger seemed to have turned peevish1 but
the child who had collected my ticket was talking volubly1  All the
party looked out across the moor where the white road departed1  I
hoped they were going to take up my tracks there1

As we moved away from that station my companion woke up1
He fixed me with a wandering glance1 kicked his dog viciously1 and
inquired where he was1  Clearly he was very drunk1

1That1s what comes o1 bein1 a teetotaller11 he observed in bitter
regret1

I expressed my surprise that in him I should have met a blue-
ribbon stalwart1

1Ay1 but I1m a strong teetotaller11 he said pugnaciously1  1I took
the pledge last Martinmas1 and I havena touched a drop o1 whisky
sinsyne1  Not even at Hogmanay1 though I was sair temptit11

He swung his heels up on the seat1 and burrowed a frowsy head
into the cushions1

1And that1s a1 I get11 he moaned1  1A heid better than hell fire1 and
twae een lookin1 different ways for the Sabbath11

1What did it11 I asked1

1A drink they ca1 brandy1  Bein1 a teetotaller I keepit off the
whisky1 but I was nip-nippin1 a1 day at this brandy1 and I doubt I1ll
no be weel for a fortnicht11  His voice died away into a splutter1 and
sleep once more laid its heavy hand on him1

My plan had been to get out at some station down the line1 but
the train suddenly gave me a better chance1 for it came to a standstill
at the end of a culvert which spanned a brawling porter-coloured
river1  I looked out and saw that every carriage window was closed
and no human figure appeared in the landscape1  So I opened the
door1 and dropped quickly into the tangle of hazels which edged
the line1

it would have been all right but for that infernal dog1  Under the
impression that I was decamping with its master1s belongings1 it
started to bark1 and all but got me by the trousers1  This woke up
the herd1 who stood bawling at the carriage door in the belief that I
had committed suicide1  I crawled through the thicket1 reached the
edge of the stream1 and in cover of the bushes put a hundred yards
or so behind me1  Then from my shelter I peered back1 and saw the
guard and several passengers gathered round the open carriage
door and staring in my direction1  I could not have made a more
public departure if I had left with a bugler and a brass band1

Happily the drunken herd provided a diversion1  He and his dog1
which was attached by a rope to his waist1 suddenly cascaded out of
the carriage1 landed on their heads on the track1 and rolled some
way down the bank towards the water1  In the rescue which followed
the dog bit somebody1 for I could hear the sound of hard swearing1
Presently they had forgotten me1 and when after a quarter of a
mile1s crawl I ventured to look back1 the train had started again and
was vanishing in the cutting1

I was in a wide semicircle of moorland1 with the brown river as
radius1 and the high hills forming the northern circumference1  There
was not a sign or sound of a human being1 only the plashing water
and the interminable crying of curlews1  Yet1 oddly enough1 for the
first time I felt the terror of the hunted on me1  It was not the police
that I thought of1 but the other folk1 who knew that I knew
Scudder1s secret and dared not let me live1  I was certain that they
would pursue me with a keenness and vigilance unknown to the
British law1 and that once their grip closed on me I should find
no mercy1

I looked back1 but there was nothing in the landscape1  The sun
glinted on the metals of the line and the wet stones in the stream1
and you could not have found a more peaceful sight in the world1
Nevertheless I started to run1  Crouching low in the runnels of the
bog1 I ran till the sweat blinded my eyes1  The mood did not leave
me till I had reached the rim of mountain and flung myself panting
on a ridge high above the young waters of the brown river1

From my vantage-ground I could scan the whole moor right
away to the railway line and to the south of it where green fields
took the place of heather1  I have eyes like a hawk1 but I could see
nothing moving in the whole countryside1  Then I looked east
beyond the ridge and saw a new kind of landscape--shallow green
valleys with plentiful fir plantations and the faint lines of dust
which spoke of highroads1  Last of all I looked into the blue May
sky1 and there I saw that which set my pulses racing 111

Low down in the south a monoplane was climbing into the
heavens1  I was as certain as if I had been told that that aeroplane
was looking for me1 and that it did not belong to the police1  For an
hour or two I watched it from a pit of heather1  It flew low along
the hill-tops1 and then in narrow circles over the valley up which I
had come1 Then it seemed to change its mind1 rose to a great
height1 and flew away back to the south1

I did not like this espionage from the air1 and I began to think
less well of the countryside I had chosen for a refuge1  These
heather hills were no sort of cover if my enemies were in the sky1
and I must find a different kind of sanctuary1  I looked with more
satisfaction to the green country beyond the ridge1 for there I
should find woods and stone houses1

About six in the evening I came out of the moorland to a white
ribbon of road which wound up the narrow vale of a lowland
stream1  As I followed it1 fields gave place to bent1 the glen became
a plateau1 and presently I had reached a kind of pass where a
solitary house smoked in the twilight1  The road swung over a
bridge1 and leaning on the parapet was a young man1

He was smoking a long clay pipe and studying the water with
spectacled eyes1  In his left hand was a small book with a finger
marking the place1  Slowly he repeated--

     As when a Gryphon through the wilderness
     With winged step1 o1er hill and moory dale
     Pursues the Arimaspian1

He jumped round as my step rung on the keystone1 and I saw a
pleasant sunburnt boyish face1

1Good evening to you11 he said gravely1  1It1s a fine night for
the road11

The smell of peat smoke and of some savoury roast floated to me
from the house1

1Is that place an inn11 I asked1

1At your service11 he said politely1  1I am the landlord1 Sir1 and I
hope you will stay the night1 for to tell you the truth I have had no
company for a week11

I pulled myself up on the parapet of the bridge and filled my
pipe1  I began to detect an ally1

1You1re young to be an innkeeper11 I said1

1My father died a year ago and left me the business1  I live there
with my grandmother1  It1s a slow job for a young man1 and it
wasn1t my choice of profession11

1Which was11

He actually blushed1  1I want to write books11 he said1

1And what better chance could you ask11 I cried1  1Man1 I1ve often
thought that an innkeeper would make the best story-teller in the world11

1Not now11 he said eagerly1  1Maybe in the old days when you had
pilgrims and ballad-makers and highwaymen and mail-coaches on
the road1  But not now1  Nothing comes here but motor-cars full of
fat women1 who stop for lunch1 and a fisherman or two in the
spring1 and the shooting tenants in August1  There is not much
material to be got out of that1  I want to see life1 to travel the world1
and write things like Kipling and Conrad1  But the most I1ve done
yet is to get some verses printed in CHAMBERS1S JOURNAL11
I looked at the inn standing golden in the sunset against the
brown hills1

1I1ve knocked a bit about the world1 and I wouldn1t despise such
a hermitage1  D1you think that adventure is found only in the tropics
or among gentry in red shirts1  Maybe you1re rubbing shoulders
with it at this moment11

1That1s what Kipling says11 he said1 his eyes brightening1 and he
quoted some verse about 1Romance bringing up the 911511

1Here1s a true tale for you then11 I cried1 1and a month from now
you can make a novel out of it11

Sitting on the bridge in the soft May gloaming I pitched him a
lovely yarn1  It was true in essentials1 too1 though I altered the
minor details1  I made out that I was a mining magnate from Kimberley1
who had had a lot of trouble with I1D1B1  and had shown up a gang1
They had pursued me across the ocean1 and had killed my best friend1 and
were now on my tracks1

I told the story well1 though I say it who shouldn1t1  I pictured a
flight across the Kalahari to German Africa1 the crackling1 parching
days1 the wonderful blue-velvet nights1  I described an attack on my
life on the voyage home1 and I made a really horrid affair of the
Portland Place murder1  1You1re looking for adventure11 I cried;
1well1 you1ve found it here1  The devils are after me1 and the police
are after them1  It1s a race that I mean to win11

1By God11 he whispered1 drawing his breath in sharply1 1it is all
pure Rider Haggard and Conan Doyle11

1You believe me11 I said gratefully1

1Of course I do11 and he held out his hand1  1I believe everything
out of the common1  The only thing to distrust is the normal11

He was very young1 but he was the man for my money1

1I think they1re off my track for the moment1 but I must lie close
for a couple of days1  Can you take me in11

He caught my elbow in his eagerness and drew me towards the
house1  1You can lie as snug here as if you were in a moss-hole1  I1ll
see that nobody blabs1 either1  And you1ll give me some more
material about your adventures11

As I entered the inn porch I heard from far off the beat of an
engine1  There silhouetted against the dusky West was my friend1
the monoplane1

He gave me a room at the back of the house1 with a fine outlook
over the plateau1 and he made me free of his own study1 which was
stacked with cheap editions of his favourite authors1  I never saw the
grandmother1 so I guessed she was bedridden1  An old woman called
Margit brought me my meals1 and the innkeeper was around me at
all hours1  I wanted some time to myself1 so I invented a job for him1
He had a motor-bicycle1 and I sent him off next morning for the daily
paper1 which usually arrived with the post in the late afternoon1  I
told him to keep his eyes skinned1 and make note of any strange
figures he saw1 keeping a special sharp look-out for motors and
aeroplanes1  Then I sat down in real earnest to Scudder1s note-book1

He came back at midday with the SCOTSMAN1  There was nothing in
it1 except some further evidence of Paddock and the milkman1 and a
repetition of yesterday1s statement that the murderer had gone
North1  But there was a long article1 reprinted from THE TIMES1 about
Karolides and the state of affairs in the Balkans1 though there was no
mention of any visit to England1  I got rid of the innkeeper for the
afternoon1 for I was getting very warm in my search for the cypher1

As I told you1 it was a numerical cypher1 and by an elaborate
system of experiments I had pretty well discovered what were the
nulls and stops1  The trouble was the key word1 and when I thought
of the odd million words he might have used I felt pretty hopeless1
But about three o1clock I had a sudden inspiration1

The name Julia Czechenyi flashed across my memory1  Scudder
had said it was the key to the Karolides business1 and it occurred to
me to try it on his cypher1

It worked1  The five letters of 1Julia1 gave me the position of the
vowels1  A was J1 the tenth letter of the alphabet1 and so represented
by X in the cypher1  E was XXI1 and so on1  1Czechenyi1 gave
me the numerals for the principal consonants1  I scribbled that
scheme on a bit of paper and sat down to read Scudder1s pages1

In half an hour I was reading with a whitish face and fingers that
drummed on the table1

I glanced out of the window and saw a big touring-car coming
up the glen towards the inn1  It drew up at the door1 and there was
the sound of people alighting1  There seemed to be two of them1
men in aquascutums and tweed caps1

Ten minutes later the innkeeper slipped into the room1 his eyes
bright with excitement1

1There1s two chaps below looking for you11 he whispered1
1They1re in the dining-room having whiskies-and-sodas1  They asked
about you and said they had hoped to meet you here1  Oh1 and they
described you jolly well1 down to your boots and shirt1  I told them
you had been here last night and had gone off on a motor bicycle
this morning1 and one of the chaps swore like a navvy11

I made him tell me what they looked like1  One was a dark-eyed
thin fellow with bushy eyebrows1 the other was always smiling and
lisped in his talk1  Neither was any kind of foreigner; on this my
young friend was positive1

I took a bit of paper and wrote these words in German as if they
were part of a letter--

     111  1Black Stone1  Scudder had got on to this1 but he could not
     act for a fortnight1  I doubt if I can do any good now1 especially
     as Karolides is uncertain about his plans1  But if Mr T1  advises 
     I will do the best I 1111

I manufactured it rather neatly1 so that it looked like a loose page
of a private letter1

1Take this down and say it was found in my bedroom1 and ask
them to return it to me if they overtake me11

Three minutes later I heard the car begin to move1 and peeping
from behind the curtain caught sight of the two figures1  One was
slim1 the other was sleek; that was the most I could make of my
reconnaissance1

The innkeeper appeared in great excitement1  1Your paper woke
them up11 he said gleefully1  1The dark fellow went as white as death
and cursed like blazes1 and the fat one whistled and looked ugly1
They paid for their drinks with half-a-sovereign and wouldn1t wait
for change11

1Now I1ll tell you what I want you to do11 I said1  1Get on your
bicycle and go off to Newton-Stewart to the Chief Constable1  Describe
the two men1 and say you suspect them of having had something to do
with the London murder1  You can invent reasons1  The two will come back1
never fear1  Not tonight1 for they1ll follow me forty miles along the
road1 but first thing tomorrow morning1  Tell the police to be here
bright and early11

He set off like a docile child1 while I worked at Scudder1s notes1
When he came back we dined together1 and in common decency I
had to let him pump me1  I gave him a lot of stuff about lion hunts
and the Matabele War1 thinking all the while what tame businesses
these were compared to this I was now engaged in1  When he went
to bed I sat up and finished Scudder1  I smoked in a chair till
daylight1 for I could not sleep1

About eight next morning I witnessed the arrival of two
constables and a sergeant1  They put their car in a coach-house under the
innkeeper1s instructions1 and entered the house1  Twenty minutes
later I saw from my window a second car come across the plateau
from the opposite direction1  It did not come up to the inn1 but
stopped two hundred yards off in the shelter of a patch of wood1  I
noticed that its occupants carefully reversed it before leaving it1  A
minute or two later I heard their steps on the gravel outside the window1

My plan had been to lie hid in my bedroom1 and see what
happened1  I had a notion that1 if I could bring the police and my
other more dangerous pursuers together1 something might work
out of it to my advantage1  But now I had a better idea1  I scribbled a
line of thanks to my host1 opened the window1 and dropped quietly
into a gooseberry bush1  Unobserved I crossed the dyke1 crawled
down the side of a tributary burn1 and won the highroad on the far
side of the patch of trees1  There stood the car1 very spick and span
in the morning sunlight1 but with the dust on her which told of a
long journey1  I started her1 jumped into the chauffeur1s seat1 and
stole gently out on to the plateau1

Almost at once the road dipped so that I lost sight of the inn1
but the wind seemed to bring me the sound of angry voices1


CHAPTER FOUR
The Adventure of the Radical Candidate

You may picture me driving that 40 h1p1  car for all she was worth
over the crisp moor roads on that shining May morning; glancing
back at first over my shoulder1 and looking anxiously to the next
turning; then driving with a vague eye1 just wide enough awake to
keep on the highway1  For I was thinking desperately of what I had
found in Scudder1s pocket-book1

The little man had told me a pack of lies1  All his yarns about the
Balkans and the Jew-Anarchists and the Foreign Office Conference
were eyewash1 and so was Karolides1  And yet not quite1 as you
shall hear1  I had staked everything on my belief in his story1 and
had been let down; here was his book telling me a different tale1
and instead of being once-bitten-twice-shy1 I believed it absolutely1

Why1 I don1t know1  It rang desperately true1 and the first yarn1 if
you understand me1 had been in a queer way true also in spirit1  The
fifteenth day of June was going to be a day of destiny1 a bigger
destiny than the killing of a Dago1  It was so big that I didn1t blame
Scudder for keeping me out of the game and wanting to play a lone
hand1  That1 I was pretty clear1 was his intention1  He had told me
something which sounded big enough1 but the real thing was so
immortally big that he1 the man who had found it out1 wanted it all
for himself1  I didn1t blame him1  It was risks after all that he was
chiefly greedy about1

The whole story was in the notes--with gaps1 you understand1
which he would have filled up from his memory1  He stuck down
his authorities1 too1 and had an odd trick of giving them all a
numerical value and then striking a balance1 which stood for the
reliability of each stage in the yarn1  The four names he had printed
were authorities1 and there was a man1 Ducrosne1 who got five out
of a possible five; and another fellow1 Ammersfoort1 who got three1
The bare bones of the tale were all that was in the book--these1
and one queer phrase which occurred half a dozen times inside
brackets1  11Thirty-nine steps11 was the phrase; and at its last time of
use it ran--11Thirty-nine steps1 I counted them--high tide 10117
p1m1111  I could make nothing of that1

The first thing I learned was that it was no question of preventing
a war1  That was coming1 as sure as Christmas1 had been arranged1
said Scudder1 ever since February 19121  Karolides was going to be
the occasion1  He was booked all right1 and was to hand in his
checks on June 14th1 two weeks and four days from that May
morning1  I gathered from Scudder1s notes that nothing on earth
could prevent that1  His talk of Epirote guards that would skin their
own grandmothers was all billy-o1

The second thing was that this war was going to come as a
mighty surprise to Britain1  Karolides1 death would set the Balkans
by the ears1 and then Vienna would chip in with an ultimatum1
Russia wouldn1t like that1 and there would be high words1  But
Berlin would play the peacemaker1 and pour oil on the waters1 till
suddenly she would find a good cause for a quarrel1 pick it up1 and
in five hours let fly at us1  That was the idea1 and a pretty good one
too1  Honey and fair speeches1 and then a stroke in the dark1  While
we were talking about the goodwill and good intentions of Germany
our coast would be silently ringed with mines1 and submarines
would be waiting for every battleship1

But all this depended upon the third thing1 which was due to
happen on June 15th1  I would never have grasped this if I hadn1t
once happened to meet a French staff officer1 coming back from
West Africa1 who had told me a lot of things1  One was that1 in
spite of all the nonsense talked in Parliament1 there was a real
working alliance between France and Britain1 and that the two
General Staffs met every now and then1 and made plans for joint
action in case of war1  Well1 in June a very great swell was coming
over from Paris1 and he was going to get nothing less than a
statement of the disposition of the British Home Fleet on mobilization1
At least I gathered it was something like that; anyhow1 it was
something uncommonly important1

But on the 15th day of June there were to be others in London--
others1 at whom I could only guess1  Scudder was content to call
them collectively the 1Black Stone11  They represented not our Allies1
but our deadly foes; and the information1 destined for France1 was
to be diverted to their pockets1  And it was to be used1 remember--
used a week or two later1 with great guns and swift torpedoes1
suddenly in the darkness of a summer night1

This was the story I had been deciphering in a back room of a
country inn1 overlooking a cabbage garden1  This was the story that
hummed in my brain as I swung in the big touring-car from glen to glen1

My first impulse had been to write a letter to the Prime Minister1
but a little reflection convinced me that that would be useless1  Who
would believe my tale1  I must show a sign1 some token in proof1
and Heaven knew what that could be1  Above all1 I must keep going
myself1 ready to act when things got riper1 and that was going to be
no light job with the police of the British Isles in full cry after me
and the watchers of the Black Stone running silently and swiftly on
my trail1

I had no very clear purpose in my journey1 but I steered east by
the sun1 for I remembered from the map that if I went north I
would come into a region of coalpits and industrial towns1  Presently
I was down from the moorlands and traversing the broad haugh of
a river1  For miles I ran alongside a park wall1 and in a break of the
trees I saw a great castle1  I swung through little old thatched
villages1 and over peaceful lowland streams1 and past gardens blazing
with hawthorn and yellow laburnum1  The land was so deep in
peace that I could scarcely believe that somewhere behind me were
those who sought my life; ay1 and that in a month1s time1 unless I
had the almightiest of luck1 these round country faces would be
pinched and staring1 and men would be lying dead in English fields1

About mid-day I entered a long straggling village1 and had a
mind to stop and eat1  Half-way down was the Post Office1 and on
the steps of it stood the postmistress and a policeman hard at work
conning a telegram1  When they saw me they wakened up1 and the
policeman advanced with raised hand1 and cried on me to stop1

I nearly was fool enough to obey1  Then it flashed upon me that
the wire had to do with me; that my friends at the inn had come to an
understanding1 and were united in desiring to see more of me1 and
that it had been easy enough for them to wire the description of me
and the car to thirty villages through which I might pass1  I released
the brakes just in time1  As it was1 the policeman made a claw at the
hood1 and only dropped off when he got my left in his eye1

I saw that main roads were no place for me1 and turned into the
byways1  It wasn1t an easy job without a map1 for there was the risk
of getting on to a farm road and ending in a duck-pond or a stable-
yard1 and I couldn1t afford that kind of delay1  I began to see what
an ass I had been to steal the car1  The big green brute would be the
safest kind of clue to me over the breadth of Scotland1  If I left it
and took to my feet1 it would be discovered in an hour or two and
I would get no start in the race1

The immediate thing to do was to get to the loneliest roads1
These I soon found when I struck up a tributary of the big river1
and got into a glen with steep hills all about me1 and a corkscrew
road at the end which climbed over a pass1  Here I met nobody1 but
it was taking me too far north1 so I slewed east along a bad track
and finally struck a big double-line railway1  Away below me I saw
another broadish valley1 and it occurred to me that if I crossed it I
might find some remote inn to pass the night1  The evening was now
drawing in1 and I was furiously hungry1 for I had eaten nothing since
breakfast except a couple of buns I had bought from a baker1s cart1
just then I heard a noise in the sky1 and lo and behold there was
that infernal aeroplane1 flying low1 about a dozen miles to the south
and rapidly coming towards me1

I had the sense to remember that on a bare moor I was at the
aeroplane1s mercy1 and that my only chance was to get to the leafy
cover of the valley1  Down the hill I went like blue lightning1
screwing my head round1 whenever I dared1 to watch that damned
flying machine1  Soon I was on a road between hedges1 and dipping
to the deep-cut glen of a stream1  Then came a bit of thick wood
where I slackened speed1

Suddenly on my left I heard the hoot of another car1 and realized
to my horror that I was almost up on a couple of gate-posts through
which a private road debouched on the highway1  My horn gave an
agonized roar1 but it was too late1  I clapped on my brakes1 but my
impetus was too great1 and there before me a car was sliding
athwart my course1  In a second there would have been the deuce of
a wreck1  I did the only thing possible1 and ran slap into the hedge
on the right1 trusting to find something soft beyond1

But there I was mistaken1  My car slithered through the hedge
like butter1 and then gave a sickening plunge forward1  I saw what
was coming1 leapt on the seat and would have jumped out1  But a
branch of hawthorn got me in the chest1 lifted me up and held me1
while a ton or two of expensive metal slipped below me1 bucked
and pitched1 and then dropped with an almighty smash fifty feet to
the bed of the stream1

Slowly that thorn let me go1  I subsided first on the hedge1 and then
very gently on a bower of nettles1  As I scrambled to my feet a hand
took me by the arm1 and a sympathetic and badly scared voice
asked me if I were hurt1

I found myself looking at a tall young man in goggles and a
leather ulster1 who kept on blessing his soul and whinnying
apologies1  For myself1 once I got my wind back1 I was rather glad
than otherwise1  This was one way of getting rid of the car1

1My blame1 Sir11 I answered him1  1It1s lucky that I did not add
homicide to my follies1  That1s the end of my Scotch motor tour1
but it might have been the end of my life11

He plucked out a watch and studied it1  1You1re the right sort of
fellow11 he said1  1I can spare a quarter of an hour1 and my house is
two minutes off1  I1ll see you clothed and fed and snug in bed1
Where1s your kit1 by the way1  Is it in the burn along with the car11

1It1s in my pocket11 I said1 brandishing a toothbrush1  1I1m a
Colonial and travel light11

1A Colonial11 he cried1  1By Gad1 you1re the very man I1ve been
praying for1  Are you by any blessed chance a Free Trader11

1I am11 said I1 without the foggiest notion of what he meant1

He patted my shoulder and hurried me into his car1  Three minutes
later we drew up before a comfortable-looking shooting box set
among pine-trees1 and he ushered me indoors1  He took me first to a
bedroom and flung half a dozen of his suits before me1 for my own
had been pretty well reduced to rags1  I selected a loose blue serge1
which differed most conspicuously from my former garments1 and
borrowed a linen collar1  Then he haled me to the dining-room1
where the remnants of a meal stood on the table1 and announced
that I had just five minutes to feed1  1You can take a snack in your
pocket1 and we1ll have supper when we get back1  I1ve got to be at
the Masonic Hall at eight o1clock1 or my agent will comb my hair11

I had a cup of coffee and some cold ham1 while he yarned away
on the hearth-rug1

1You find me in the deuce of a mess1 Mr--by-the-by1 you
haven1t told me your name1  Twisdon1  Any relation of old Tommy
Twisdon of the Sixtieth1  No1  Well1 you see I1m Liberal Candidate
for this part of the world1 and I had a meeting on tonight at
Brattleburn--that1s my chief town1 and an infernal Tory stronghold1
I had got the Colonial ex-Premier fellow1 Crumpleton1 coming to
speak for me tonight1 and had the thing tremendously billed and
the whole place ground-baited1  This afternoon I had a wire from
the ruffian saying he had got influenza at Blackpool1 and here am I
left to do the whole thing myself1  I had meant to speak for ten
minutes and must now go on for forty1 and1 though I1ve been
racking my brains for three hours to think of something1 I simply
cannot last the course1  Now you1ve got to be a good chap and help
me1  You1re a Free Trader and can tell our people what a wash-out
Protection is in the Colonies1  All you fellows have the gift of the
gab--I wish to Heaven I had it1  I1ll be for evermore in your debt11

I had very few notions about Free Trade one way or the other1
but I saw no other chance to get what I wanted1  My young gentleman
was far too absorbed in his own difficulties to think how odd
it was to ask a stranger who had just missed death by an ace and
had lost a 11000-guinea car to address a meeting for him on the spur
of the moment1  But my necessities did not allow me to contemplate
oddnesses or to pick and choose my supports1

1All right11 I said1  1I1m not much good as a speaker1 but I1ll tell
them a bit about Australia11

At my words the cares of the ages slipped from his shoulders1
and he was rapturous in his thanks1  He lent me a big driving coat--
and never troubled to ask why I had started on a motor tour
without possessing an ulster--and1 as we slipped down the dusty
roads1 poured into my ears the simple facts of his history1  He was
an orphan1 and his uncle had brought him up--I1ve forgotten the
uncle1s name1 but he was in the Cabinet1 and you can read his
speeches in the papers1  He had gone round the world after leaving
Cambridge1 and then1 being short of a job1 his uncle had advised
politics1  I gathered that he had no preference in parties1  1Good
chaps in both11 he said cheerfully1 1and plenty of blighters1 too1  I1m
Liberal1 because my family have always been Whigs11  But if he was
lukewarm politically he had strong views on other things1  He
found out I knew a bit about horses1 and jawed away about the
Derby entries; and he was full of plans for improving his shooting1
Altogether1 a very clean1 decent1 callow young man1

As we passed through a little town two policemen signalled us to
stop1 and flashed their lanterns on us1

1Beg pardon1 Sir Harry11 said one1  1We1ve got instructions to
look out for a car1 and the description1s no unlike yours11

1Right-o11 said my host1 while I thanked Providence for the
devious ways I had been brought to safety1  After that he spoke no
more1 for his mind began to labour heavily with his coming speech1
His lips kept muttering1 his eye wandered1 and I began to prepare
myself for a second catastrophe1  I tried to think of something to say
myself1 but my mind was dry as a stone1  The next thing I knew we
had drawn up outside a door in a street1 and were being welcomed
by some noisy gentlemen with rosettes1
The hall had about five hundred in it1 women mostly1 a lot of
bald heads1 and a dozen or two young men1  The chairman1 a
weaselly minister with a reddish nose1 lamented Crumpleton1s absence1
soliloquized on his influenza1 and gave me a certificate as a
1trusted leader of Australian thought11  There were two policemen at
the door1 and I hoped they took note of that testimonial1  Then Sir
Harry started1

I never heard anything like it1  He didn1t begin to know how to
talk1  He had about a bushel of notes from which he read1 and when
he let go of them he fell into one prolonged stutter1  Every now and
then he remembered a phrase he had learned by heart1 straightened
his back1 and gave it off like Henry Irving1 and the next moment he
was bent double and crooning over his papers1  It was the most
appalling rot1 too1  He talked about the 1German menace11 and said
it was all a Tory invention to cheat the poor of their rights and
keep back the great flood of social reform1 but that 1organized
labour1 realized this and laughed the Tories to scorn1  He was all for
reducing our Navy as a proof of our good faith1 and then sending
Germany an ultimatum telling her to do the same or we would
knock her into a cocked hat1  He said that1 but for the Tories1
Germany and Britain would be fellow-workers in peace and reform1
I thought of the little black book in my pocket1  A giddy lot Scudder1s
friends cared for peace and reform1

Yet in a queer way I liked the speech1  You could see the niceness
of the chap shining out behind the muck with which he had been
spoon-fed1  Also it took a load off my mind1  I mightn1t be much of
an orator1 but I was a thousand per cent better than Sir Harry1

I didn1t get on so badly when it came to my turn1  I simply told
them all I could remember about Australia1 praying there should be
no Australian there--all about its labour party and emigration and
universal service1  I doubt if I remembered to mention Free Trade1
but I said there were no Tories in Australia1 only Labour and
Liberals1  That fetched a cheer1 and I woke them up a bit when I
started in to tell them the kind of glorious business I thought could
be made out of the Empire if we really put our backs into it1

Altogether I fancy I was rather a success1  The minister didn1t like
me1 though1 and when he proposed a vote of thanks1 spoke of Sir
Harry1s speech as 1statesmanlike1 and mine as having 1the eloquence
of an emigration agent11

When we were in the car again my host was in wild spirits at
having got his job over1  1A ripping speech1 Twisdon11 he said1
1Now1 you1re coming home with me1  I1m all alone1 and if you1ll
stop a day or two I1ll show you some very decent fishing11

We had a hot supper--and I wanted it pretty badly--and then
drank grog in a big cheery smoking-room with a crackling wood
fire1  I thought the time had come for me to put my cards on the
table1  I saw by this man1s eye that he was the kind you can trust1

1Listen1 Sir Harry11 I said1  1I1ve something pretty important to
say to you1  You1re a good fellow1 and I1m going to be frank1
Where on earth did you get that poisonous rubbish you talked tonight11

His face fell1  1Was it as bad as that11 he asked ruefully1  1It did
sound rather thin1  I got most of it out of the PROGRESSIVE MAGAZINE
and pamphlets that agent chap of mine keeps sending me1  But you
surely don1t think Germany would ever go to war with us11

1Ask that question in six weeks and it won1t need an answer11 I
said1  1If you1ll give me your attention for half an hour I am going
to tell you a story11

I can see yet that bright room with the deers1 heads and the old
prints on the walls1 Sir Harry standing restlessly on the stone curb
of the hearth1 and myself lying back in an armchair1 speaking1  I
seemed to be another person1 standing aside and listening to my
own voice1 and judging carefully the reliability of my tale1  It was
the first time I had ever told anyone the exact truth1 so far as I
understood it1 and it did me no end of good1 for it straightened out
the thing in my own mind1  I blinked no detail1  He heard all about
Scudder1 and the milkman1 and the note-book1 and my doings in
Galloway1  Presently he got very excited and walked up and down
the hearth-rug1

1So you see11 I concluded1 1you have got here in your house the
man that is wanted for the Portland Place murder1  Your duty is to
send your car for the police and give me up1  I don1t think I1ll get
very far1  There1ll be an accident1 and I1ll have a knife in my ribs an
hour or so after arrest1  Nevertheless1 it1s your duty1 as a law-abiding
citizen1  Perhaps in a month1s time you1ll be sorry1 but you have no
cause to think of that11

He was looking at me with bright steady eyes1  1What was your
job in Rhodesia1 Mr Hannay11 he asked1

1Mining engineer11 I said1  1I1ve made my pile cleanly and I1ve had
a good time in the making of it11

1Not a profession that weakens the nerves1 is it11

I laughed1  1Oh1 as to that1 my nerves are good enough11  I took
down a hunting-knife from a stand on the wall1 and did the old
Mashona trick of tossing it and catching it in my lips1  That wants a
pretty steady heart1

He watched me with a smile1  1I don1t want proof1  I may be an ass
on the platform1 but I can size up a man1  You1re no murderer and
you1re no fool1 and I believe you are speaking the truth1  I1m going
to back you up1  Now1 what can I do11

1First1 I want you to write a letter to your uncle1  I1ve got to get
in touch with the Government people sometime before the 15th of June11

He pulled his moustache1  1That won1t help you1  This is Foreign
Office business1 and my uncle would have nothing to do with it1
Besides1 you1d never convince him1  No1 I1ll go one better1  I1ll write
to the Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office1  He1s my godfather1
and one of the best going1  What do you want11

He sat down at a table and wrote to my dictation1  The gist of it
was that if a man called Twisdon 1I thought I had better stick to
that name1 turned up before June 15th he was to entreat him
kindly1  He said Twisdon would prove his bona fides by passing the
word 1Black Stone1 and whistling 1Annie Laurie11

1Good11 said Sir Harry1  1That1s the proper style1  By the way1
you1ll find my godfather--his name1s Sir Walter Bullivant--down
at his country cottage for Whitsuntide1  It1s close to Artinswell on
the Kenner1  That1s done1  Now1 what1s the next thing11

1You1re about my height1  Lend me the oldest tweed suit you1ve
got1  Anything will do1 so long as the colour is the opposite of the
clothes I destroyed this afternoon1  Then show me a map of the
neighbourhood and explain to me the lie of the land1  Lastly1 if
the police come seeking me1 just show them the car in the glen1  If
the other lot turn up1 tell them I caught the south express after your
meeting11

He did1 or promised to do1 all these things1  I shaved off the
remnants of my moustache1 and got inside an ancient suit of what I
believe is called heather mixture1  The map gave me some notion of
my whereabouts1 and told me the two things I wanted to know--
where the main railway to the south could be joined and what were
the wildest districts near at hand1
At two o1clock he wakened me from my slumbers in the
smoking-room armchair1 and led me blinking into the dark starry
night1  An old bicycle was found in a tool-shed and handed over to me1

1First turn to the right up by the long fir-wood11 he enjoined1  1By
daybreak you1ll be well into the hills1  Then I should pitch the
machine into a bog and take to the moors on foot1  You can put in a
week among the shepherds1 and be as safe as if you were in New
Guinea11

I pedalled diligently up steep roads of hill gravel till the skies
grew pale with morning1  As the mists cleared before the sun1 I
found myself in a wide green world with glens falling on every side
and a far-away blue horizon1  Here1 at any rate1 I could get early
news of my enemies1


CHAPTER FIVE
The Adventure of the Spectacled Roadman


I sat down on the very crest of the pass and took stock of my position1

Behind me was the road climbing through a long cleft in the
hills1 which was the upper glen of some notable river1  In front was
a flat space of maybe a mile1 all pitted with bog-holes and rough
with tussocks1 and then beyond it the road fell steeply down another
glen to a plain whose blue dimness melted into the distance1  To left
and right were round-shouldered green hills as smooth as pancakes1
but to the south--that is1 the left hand--there was a glimpse of
high heathery mountains1 which I remembered from the map as the
big knot of hill which I had chosen for my sanctuary1  I was on the
central boss of a huge upland country1 and could see everything
moving for miles1  In the meadows below the road half a mile back
a cottage smoked1 but it was the only sign of human life1  Otherwise
there was only the calling of plovers and the tinkling of little streams1

It was now about seven o1clock1 and as I waited I heard once
again that ominous beat in the air1  Then I realized that my vantage-
ground might be in reality a trap1  There was no cover for a tomtit
in those bald green places1

I sat quite still and hopeless while the beat grew louder1  Then I
saw an aeroplane coming up from the east1  It was flying high1 but
as I looked it dropped several hundred feet and began to circle
round the knot of hill in narrowing circles1 just as a hawk wheels
before it pounces1  Now it was flying very low1 and now the observer
on board caught sight of me1  I could see one of the two occupants
examining me through glasses1

Suddenly it began to rise in swift whorls1 and the next I knew
it was speeding eastward again till it became a speck in the
blue morning1

That made me do some savage thinking1  My enemies had located
me1 and the next thing would be a cordon round me1  I didn1t know
what force they could command1 but I was certain it would be
sufficient1  The aeroplane had seen my bicycle1 and would conclude
that I would try to escape by the road1  In that case there might be a
chance on the moors to the right or left1  I wheeled the machine a
hundred yards from the highway1 and plunged it into a moss-hole1
where it sank among pond-weed and water-buttercups1  Then I
climbed to a knoll which gave me a view of the two valleys1
Nothing was stirring on the long white ribbon that threaded them1

I have said there was not cover in the whole place to hide a rat1
As the day advanced it was flooded with soft fresh light till it had
the fragrant sunniness of the South African veld1  At other times I
would have liked the place1 but now it seemed to suffocate me1  The
free moorlands were prison walls1 and the keen hill air was the
breath of a dungeon1

I tossed a coin--heads right1 tails left--and it fell heads1 so I
turned to the north1  In a little I came to the brow of the ridge
which was the containing wall of the pass1  I saw the highroad for
maybe ten miles1 and far down it something that was moving1 and
that I took to be a motor-car1  Beyond the ridge I looked on a
rolling green moor1 which fell away into wooded glens1

Now my life on the veld has given me the eyes of a kite1 and I
can see things for which most men need a telescope 111  Away
down the slope1 a couple of miles away1 several men were advancing1
like a row of beaters at a shoot 111

I dropped out of sight behind the sky-line1  That way was shut to
me1 and I must try the bigger hills to the south beyond the highway1
The car I had noticed was getting nearer1 but it was still a long way
off with some very steep gradients before it1  I ran hard1 crouching
low except in the hollows1 and as I ran I kept scanning the brow of
the hill before me1  Was it imagination1 or did I see figures--one1
two1 perhaps more--moving in a glen beyond the stream1

If you are hemmed in on all sides in a patch of land there is only
one chance of escape1  You must stay in the patch1 and let your
enemies search it and not find you1  That was good sense1 but how
on earth was I to escape notice in that table-cloth of a place1  I
would have buried myself to the neck in mud or lain below water
or climbed the tallest tree1  But there was not a stick of wood1 the
bog-holes were little puddles1 the stream was a slender trickle1  There
was nothing but short heather1 and bare hill bent1 and the white highway1

Then in a tiny bight of road1 beside a heap of stones1 I found
the roadman1

He had just arrived1 and was wearily flinging down his hammer1
He looked at me with a fishy eye and yawned1

1Confoond the day I ever left the herdin111 he said1 as if to the
world at large1  1There I was my ain maister1  Now I1m a slave to the
Goavernment1 tethered to the roadside1 wi1 sair een1 and a back like
a suckle11

He took up the hammer1 struck a stone1 dropped the implement
with an oath1 and put both hands to his ears1  1Mercy on me1  My
heid1s burstin111 he cried1

He was a wild figure1 about my own size but much bent1 with a
week1s beard on his chin1 and a pair of big horn spectacles1

1I canna dae1t11 he cried again1  1The Surveyor maun just report
me1  I1m for my bed11

I asked him what was the trouble1 though indeed that was
clear enough1

1The trouble is that I1m no sober1  Last nicht my dochter Merran
was waddit1 and they danced till fower in the byre1  Me and some
ither chiels sat down to the drinkin11 and here I am1  Peety that I
ever lookit on the wine when it was red11

I agreed with him about bed1
1It1s easy speakin111 he moaned1  1But I got a postcard yestreen
sayin1 that the new Road Surveyor would be round the day1  He1ll
come and he1ll no find me1 or else he1ll find me fou1 and either way
I1m a done man1  I1ll awa1 back to my bed and say I1m no weel1 but
I doot that1ll no help me1 for they ken my kind o1 no-weel-ness11

Then I had an inspiration1  1Does the new Surveyor know you11
I asked1

1No him1  He1s just been a week at the job1  He rins about in a wee
motor-cawr1 and wad speir the inside oot o1 a whelk11

1Where1s your house11 I asked1 and was directed by a wavering
finger to the cottage by the stream1

1Well1 back to your bed11 I said1 1and sleep in peace1  I1ll take on
your job for a bit and see the Surveyor11

He stared at me blankly; then1 as the notion dawned on his
fuddled brain1 his face broke into the vacant drunkard1s smile1

1You1re the billy11 he cried1  1It1ll be easy eneuch managed1  I1ve
finished that bing o1 stanes1 so you needna chap ony mair this
forenoon1  Just take the barry1 and wheel eneuch metal frae yon
quarry doon the road to mak anither bing the morn1  My name1s
Alexander Turnbull1 and I1ve been seeven year at the trade1 and
twenty afore that herdin1 on Leithen Water1  My freens ca1 me Ecky1
and whiles Specky1 for I wear glesses1 being waik i1 the sicht1  Just
you speak the Surveyor fair1 and ca1 him Sir1 and he1ll be fell
pleased1  I1ll be back or mid-day11

I borrowed his spectacles and filthy old hat; stripped off coat1
waistcoat1 and collar1 and gave him them to carry home; borrowed1
too1 the foul stump of a clay pipe as an extra property1  He indicated
my simple tasks1 and without more ado set off at an amble bedwards1
Bed may have been his chief object1 but I think there was
also something left in the foot of a bottle1  I prayed that he might be
safe under cover before my friends arrived on the scene1

Then I set to work to dress for the part1  I opened the collar of
my shirt--it was a vulgar blue-and-white check such as ploughmen
wear--and revealed a neck as brown as any tinker1s1  I rolled up my
sleeves1 and there was a forearm which might have been a blacksmith1s1
sunburnt and rough with old scars1  I got my boots and trouser-legs
all white from the dust of the road1 and hitched up my trousers1 
tying them with string below the knee1  Then I set to work on my face1
With a handful of dust I made a water-mark round my neck1 the place
where Mr Turnbull1s Sunday ablutions might be expected to stop1
I rubbed a good deal of dirt also into the sunburn of my cheeks1  
A roadman1s eyes would no doubt be a little inflamed1 so I contrived
to get some dust in both of mine1 and by dint of vigorous rubbing
produced a bleary effect1

The sandwiches Sir Harry had given me had gone off with my
coat1 but the roadman1s lunch1 tied up in a red handkerchief1 was at
my disposal1  I ate with great relish several of the thick slabs of
scone and cheese and drank a little of the cold tea1  In the handkerchief
was a local paper tied with string and addressed to Mr Turnbull--
obviously meant to solace his mid-day leisure1  I did up the
bundle again1 and put the paper conspicuously beside it1

My boots did not satisfy me1 but by dint of kicking among the
stones I reduced them to the granite-like surface which marks a
roadman1s foot-gear1  Then I bit and scraped my finger-nails till the
edges were all cracked and uneven1  The men I was matched against
would miss no detail1  I broke one of the bootlaces and retied it in a
clumsy knot1 and loosed the other so that my thick grey socks
bulged over the uppers1  Still no sign of anything on the road1  The
motor I had observed half an hour ago must have gone home1

My toilet complete1 I took up the barrow and began my journeys
to and from the quarry a hundred yards off1

I remember an old scout in Rhodesia1 who had done many queer
things in his day1 once telling me that the secret of playing a part
was to think yourself into it1  You could never keep it up1 he said1
unless you could manage to convince yourself that you were it1  So I
shut off all other thoughts and switched them on to the road-
mending1  I thought of the little white cottage as my home1 I
recalled the years I had spent herding on Leithen Water1 I made my
mind dwell lovingly on sleep in a box-bed and a bottle of cheap
whisky1  Still nothing appeared on that long white road1

Now and then a sheep wandered off the heather to stare at me1  A
heron flopped down to a pool in the stream and started to fish1
taking no more notice of me than if I had been a milestone1  On I
went1 trundling my loads of stone1 with the heavy step of the
professional1  Soon I grew warm1 and the dust on my face changed
into solid and abiding grit1  I was already counting the hours till
evening should put a limit to Mr Turnbull1s monotonous toil1
Suddenly a crisp voice spoke from the road1 and looking up I
saw a little Ford two-seater1 and a round-faced young man in a
bowler hat1

1Are you Alexander Turnbull11 he asked1  1I am the new County
Road Surveyor1  You live at Blackhopefoot1 and have charge of the
section from Laidlawbyres to the Riggs1  Good1  A fair bit of road1
Turnbull1 and not badly engineered1  A little soft about a mile off1
and the edges want cleaning1  See you look after that1  Good morning1
You1ll know me the next time you see me11

Clearly my get-up was good enough for the dreaded Surveyor1  I
went on with my work1 and as the morning grew towards noon I
was cheered by a little traffic1  A baker1s van breasted the hill1 and
sold me a bag of ginger biscuits which I stowed in my trouser-
pockets against emergencies1  Then a herd passed with sheep1 and
disturbed me somewhat by asking loudly1 1What had become o1 Specky11

1In bed wi1 the colic11 I replied1 and the herd passed on 111
just about mid-day a big car stole down the hill1 glided past and
drew up a hundred yards beyond1  Its three occupants descended as
if to stretch their legs1 and sauntered towards me1

Two of the men I had seen before from the window of the
Galloway inn--one lean1 sharp1 and dark1 the other comfortable
and smiling1  The third had the look of a countryman--a vet1
perhaps1 or a small farmer1  He was dressed in ill-cut knickerbockers1
and the eye in his head was as bright and wary as a hen1s1

1Morning11 said the last1  1That1s a fine easy job o1 yours11

I had not looked up on their approach1 and now1 when accosted1
I slowly and painfully straightened my back1 after the manner of
roadmen; spat vigorously1 after the manner of the low Scot; and
regarded them steadily before replying1  I confronted three pairs of
eyes that missed nothing1

1There1s waur jobs and there1s better11 I said sententiously1  1I wad
rather hae yours1 sittin1 a1 day on your hinderlands on thae cushions1
It1s you and your muckle cawrs that wreck my roads1  If we a1 had
oor richts1 ye sud be made to mend what ye break11

The bright-eyed man was looking at the newspaper lying beside
Turnbull1s bundle1

1I see you get your papers in good time11 he said1

I glanced at it casually1  1Aye1 in gude time1  Seein1 that that paper
cam1 out last Setterday I1m just Sax days late11

He picked it up1 glanced at the superscription1 and laid it down
again1  One of the others had been looking at my boots1 and a word
in German called the speaker1s attention to them1

1You1ve a fine taste in boots11 he said1  1These were never made
by a country shoemaker11

1They were not11 I said readily1  1They were made in London1  I
got them frae the gentleman that was here last year for the shootin11
What was his name now11  And I scratched a forgetful head1
Again the sleek one spoke in German1  1Let us get on11 he said1
1This fellow is all right11

They asked one last question1

1Did you see anyone pass early this morning1  He might be on a
bicycle or he might be on foot11

I very nearly fell into the trap and told a story of a bicyclist
hurrying past in the grey dawn1  But I had the sense to see my
danger1  I pretended to consider very deeply1

1I wasna up very early11 I said1  1Ye see1 my dochter was merrit
last nicht1 and we keepit it up late1  I opened the house door about
seeven and there was naebody on the road then1  Since I cam1 up
here there has just been the baker and the Ruchill herd1 besides you
gentlemen11

One of them gave me a cigar1 which I smelt gingerly and stuck
in Turnbull1s bundle1  They got into their car and were out of sight
in three minutes1

My heart leaped with an enormous relief1 but I went on wheeling
my stones1  It was as well1 for ten minutes later the car returned1 one
of the occupants waving a hand to me1  Those gentry left nothing
to chance1

I finished Turnbull1s bread and cheese1 and pretty soon I had
finished the stones1  The next step was what puzzled me1  I could not
keep up this roadmaking business for long1  A merciful Providence
had kept Mr Turnbull indoors1 but if he appeared on the scene
there would be trouble1  I had a notion that the cordon was still
tight round the glen1 and that if I walked in any direction I should
meet with questioners1  But get out I must1  No man1s nerve could
stand more than a day of being spied on1

I stayed at my post till five o1clock1  By that time I had resolved
to go down to Turnbull1s cottage at nightfall and take my chance
of getting over the hills in the darkness1  But suddenly a new car
came up the road1 and slowed down a yard or two from me1  A
fresh wind had risen1 and the occupant wanted to light a cigarette1
It was a touring car1 with the tonneau full of an assortment of
baggage1  One man sat in it1 and by an amazing chance I knew him1
His name was Marmaduke jopley1 and he was an offence to creation1
He was a sort of blood stockbroker1 who did his business by
toadying eldest sons and rich young peers and foolish old ladies1
1Marmie1 was a familiar figure1 I understood1 at balls and polo-
weeks and country houses1  He was an adroit scandal-monger1 and
would crawl a mile on his belly to anything that had a title or a
million1  I had a business introduction to his firm when I came to
London1 and he was good enough to ask me to dinner at his club1
There he showed off at a great rate1 and pattered about his duchesses
till the snobbery of the creature turned me sick1  I asked a man
afterwards why nobody kicked him1 and was told that Englishmen
reverenced the weaker sex1

Anyhow there he was now1 nattily dressed1 in a fine new car1
obviously on his way to visit some of his smart friends1  A sudden
daftness took me1 and in a second I had jumped into the tonneau
and had him by the shoulder1

1Hullo1 jopley11 I sang out1  1Well met1 my lad11  He got a horrid
fright1  His chin dropped as he stared at me1  1Who the devil are
YOU11 he gasped1

1My name1s Hannay11 I said1  1From Rhodesia1 you remember11

1Good God1 the murderer11 he choked1

1Just so1  And there1ll be a second murder1 my dear1 if you don1t
do as I tell you1  Give me that coat of yours1  That cap1 too11

He did as bid1 for he was blind with terror1  Over my dirty
trousers and vulgar shirt I put on his smart driving-coat1 which
buttoned high at the top and thereby hid the deficiencies of my
collar1  I stuck the cap on my head1 and added his gloves to my get-
up1  The dusty roadman in a minute was transformed into one of
the neatest motorists in Scotland1  On Mr jopley1s head I clapped
Turnbull1s unspeakable hat1 and told him to keep it there1

Then with some difficulty I turned the car1  My plan was to go
back the road he had come1 for the watchers1 having seen it before1
would probably let it pass unremarked1 and Marmie1s figure was in
no way like mine1

1Now1 my child11 I said1 1sit quite still and be a good boy1  I mean
you no harm1  I1m only borrowing your car for an hour or two1  But
if you play me any tricks1 and above all if you open your mouth1 as
sure as there1s a God above me I1ll wring your neck1  SAVEZ11

I enjoyed that evening1s ride1  We ran eight miles down the
valley1 through a village or two1 and I could not help noticing
several strange-looking folk lounging by the roadside1  These were
the watchers who would have had much to say to me if I had come
in other garb or company1  As it was1 they looked incuriously on1
One touched his cap in salute1 and I responded graciously1

As the dark fell I turned up a side glen which1 as I remember
from the map1 led into an unfrequented corner of the hills1  Soon
the villages were left behind1 then the farms1 and then even the
wayside cottage1  Presently we came to a lonely moor where the
night was blackening the sunset gleam in the bog pools1  Here we
stopped1 and I obligingly reversed the car and restored to Mr
jopley his belongings1

1A thousand thanks11 I said1  1There1s more use in you than I
thought1  Now be off and find the police11

As I sat on the hillside1 watching the tail-light dwindle1 I reflected
on the various kinds of crime I had now sampled1  Contrary to
general belief1 I was not a murderer1 but I had become an unholy
liar1 a shameless impostor1 and a highwayman with a marked taste
for expensive motor-cars1


CHAPTER SIX
The Adventure of the Bald Archaeologist


I spent the night on a shelf of the hillside1 in the lee of a boulder
where the heather grew long and soft1  It was a cold business1 for I
had neither coat nor waistcoat1  These were in Mr Turnbull1s keeping1
as was Scudder1s little book1 my watch and--worst of all--my
pipe and tobacco pouch1  Only my money accompanied me in my
belt1 and about half a pound of ginger biscuits in my trousers pocket1

I supped off half those biscuits1 and by worming myself deep
into the heather got some kind of warmth1  My spirits had risen1
and I was beginning to enjoy this crazy game of hide-and-seek1  So
far I had been miraculously lucky1  The milkman1 the literary
innkeeper1 Sir Harry1 the roadman1 and the idiotic Marmie1 were all
pieces of undeserved good fortune1  Somehow the first success gave
me a feeling that I was going to pull the thing through1

My chief trouble was that I was desperately hungry1  When a Jew
shoots himself in the City and there is an inquest1 the newspapers
usually report that the deceased was 1well-nourished11  I remember
thinking that they would not call me well-nourished if I broke my
neck in a bog-hole1  I lay and tortured myself--for the ginger
biscuits merely emphasized the aching void--with the memory of
all the good food I had thought so little of in London1  There were
Paddock1s crisp sausages and fragrant shavings of bacon1 and
shapely poached eggs--how often I had turned up my nose at
them1  There were the cutlets they did at the club1 and a particular
ham that stood on the cold table1 for which my soul lusted1  My
thoughts hovered over all varieties of mortal edible1 and finally
settled on a porterhouse steak and a quart of bitter with a welsh
rabbit to follow1  In longing hopelessly for these dainties I
fell asleep1

I woke very cold and stiff about an hour after dawn1  It took me
a little while to remember where I was1 for I had been very weary
and had slept heavily1  I saw first the pale blue sky through a net of
heather1 then a big shoulder of hill1 and then my own boots placed
neatly in a blaeberry bush1  I raised myself on my arms and looked
down into the valley1 and that one look set me lacing up my boots
in mad haste1

For there were men below1 not more than a quarter of a mile off1
spaced out on the hillside like a fan1 and beating the heather1
Marmie had not been slow in looking for his revenge1

I crawled out of my shelf into the cover of a boulder1 and from it
gained a shallow trench which slanted up the mountain face1  This led
me presently into the narrow gully of a burn1 by way of which I
scrambled to the top of the ridge1  From there I looked back1 and
saw that I was still undiscovered1  My pursuers were patiently quartering
the hillside and moving upwards1

Keeping behind the skyline I ran for maybe half a mile1 till I
judged I was above the uppermost end of the glen1  Then I showed
myself1 and was instantly noted by one of the flankers1 who passed
the word to the others1  I heard cries coming up from below1 and
saw that the line of search had changed its direction1  I pretended to
retreat over the skyline1 but instead went back the way I had come1
and in twenty minutes was behind the ridge overlooking my sleeping
place1  From that viewpoint I had the satisfaction of seeing the
pursuit streaming up the hill at the top of the glen on a hopelessly
false scent1

I had before me a choice of routes1 and I chose a ridge which
made an angle with the one I was on1 and so would soon put a
deep glen between me and my enemies1  The exercise had warmed
my blood1 and I was beginning to enjoy myself amazingly1  As I
went I breakfasted on the dusty remnants of the ginger biscuits1

I knew very little about the country1 and I hadn1t a notion what I
was going to do1  I trusted to the strength of my legs1 but I was
well aware that those behind me would be familiar with the lie of
the land1 and that my ignorance would be a heavy handicap1  I saw
in front of me a sea of hills1 rising very high towards the south1 but
northwards breaking down into broad ridges which separated wide
and shallow dales1  The ridge I had chosen seemed to sink after a
mile or two to a moor which lay like a pocket in the uplands1  That
seemed as good a direction to take as any other1

My stratagem had given me a fair start--call it twenty minutes--
and I had the width of a glen behind me before I saw the first heads
of the pursuers1  The police had evidently called in local talent to
their aid1 and the men I could see had the appearance of herds or
gamekeepers1  They hallooed at the sight of me1 and I waved my
hand1  Two dived into the glen and began to climb my ridge1 while
the others kept their own side of the hill1  I felt as if I were taking
part in a schoolboy game of hare and hounds1

But very soon it began to seem less of a game1  Those fellows
behind were hefty men on their native heath1  Looking back I saw
that only three were following direct1 and I guessed that the others
had fetched a circuit to cut me off1  My lack of local knowledge
might very well be my undoing1 and I resolved to get out of this
tangle of glens to the pocket of moor I had seen from the tops1  I
must so increase my distance as to get clear away from them1 and I
believed I could do this if I could find the right ground for it1  If
there had been cover I would have tried a bit of stalking1 but on
these bare slopes you could see a fly a mile off1  My hope must be in
the length of my legs and the soundness of my wind1 but I needed
easier ground for that1 for I was not bred a mountaineer1  How I
longed for a good Afrikander pony1

I put on a great spurt and got off my ridge and down into the
moor before any figures appeared on the skyline behind me1  I
crossed a burn1 and came out on a highroad which made a pass
between two glens1  All in front of me was a big field of heather
sloping up to a crest which was crowned with an odd feather of
trees1  In the dyke by the roadside was a gate1 from which a grass-
grown track led over the first wave of the moor1

I jumped the dyke and followed it1 and after a few hundred yards
--as soon as it was out of sight of the highway--the grass stopped
and it became a very respectable road1 which was evidently kept
with some care1  Clearly it ran to a house1 and I began to think of
doing the same1  Hitherto my luck had held1 and it might be that my
best chance would be found in this remote dwelling1  Anyhow there
were trees there1 and that meant cover1

I did not follow the road1 but the burnside which flanked it on
the right1 where the bracken grew deep and the high banks made a
tolerable screen1  It was well I did so1 for no sooner had I gained the
hollow than1 looking back1 I saw the pursuit topping the ridge
from which I had descended1

After that I did not look back; I had no time1  I ran up the
burnside1 crawling over the open places1 and for a large part wading
in the shallow stream1  I found a deserted cottage with a row of
phantom peat-stacks and an overgrown garden1  Then I was among
young hay1 and very soon had come to the edge of a plantation of
wind-blown firs1  From there I saw the chimneys of the house smoking
a few hundred yards to my left1  I forsook the burnside1 crossed
another dyke1 and almost before I knew was on a rough lawn1  A
glance back told me that I was well out of sight of the pursuit1
which had not yet passed the first lift of the moor1

The lawn was a very rough place1 cut with a scythe instead of a
mower1 and planted with beds of scrubby rhododendrons1  A brace
of black-game1 which are not usually garden birds1 rose at my
approach1  The house before me was the ordinary moorland farm1
with a more pretentious whitewashed wing added1  Attached to this
wing was a glass veranda1 and through the glass I saw the face of
an elderly gentleman meekly watching me1

I stalked over the border of coarse hill gravel and entered the
open veranda door1  Within was a pleasant room1 glass on one side1
and on the other a mass of books1  More books showed in an inner
room1  On the floor1 instead of tables1 stood cases such as you see in
a museum1 filled with coins and queer stone implements1

There was a knee-hole desk in the middle1 and seated at it1 with
some papers and open volumes before him1 was the benevolent old
gentleman1  His face was round and shiny1 like Mr Pickwick1s1 big
glasses were stuck on the end of his nose1 and the top of his head
was as bright and bare as a glass bottle1  He never moved when I
entered1 but raised his placid eyebrows and waited on me to speak1

It was not an easy job1 with about five minutes to spare1 to tell a
stranger who I was and what I wanted1 and to win his aid1  I did not
attempt it1  There was something about the eye of the man before
me1 something so keen and knowledgeable1 that I could not find a
word1  I simply stared at him and stuttered1

1You seem in a hurry1 my friend11he said slowly1

I nodded towards the window1  It gave a prospect across the
moor through a gap in the plantation1 and revealed certain figures
half a mile off straggling through the heather1

1Ah1 I see11 he said1 and took up a pair of field-glasses through
which he patiently scrutinized the figures1

1A fugitive from justice1 eh1  Well1 we1ll go into the matter at our
leisure1  Meantime I object to my privacy being broken in upon by
the clumsy rural policeman1  Go into my study1 and you will see
two doors facing you1  Take the one on the left and close it behind
you1  You will be perfectly safe11

And this extraordinary man took up his pen again1

I did as I was bid1 and found myself in a little dark chamber
which smelt of chemicals1 and was lit only by a tiny window high
up in the wall1  The door had swung behind me with a click like the
door of a safe1  Once again I had found an unexpected sanctuary1

All the same I was not comfortable1  There was something about
the old gentleman which puzzled and rather terrified me1  He had
been too easy and ready1 almost as if he had expected me1  And his
eyes had been horribly intelligent1

No sound came to me in that dark place1  For all I knew the
police might be searching the house1 and if they did they would
want to know what was behind this door1  I tried to possess my soul
in patience1 and to forget how hungry I was1

Then I took a more cheerful view1  The old gentleman could scarcely
refuse me a meal1 and I fell to reconstructing my breakfast1  Bacon
and eggs would content me1 but I wanted the better part of a flitch
of bacon and half a hundred eggs1  And then1 while my mouth was
watering in anticipation1 there was a click and the door stood open1

I emerged into the sunlight to find the master of the house
sitting in a deep armchair in the room he called his study1 and
regarding me with curious eyes1

1Have they gone11 I asked1

1They have gone1  I convinced them that you had crossed the hill1
I do not choose that the police should come between me and one
whom I am delighted to honour1  This is a lucky morning for you1
Mr Richard Hannay11

As he spoke his eyelids seemed to tremble and to fall a little over
his keen grey eyes1  In a flash the phrase of Scudder1s came back to
me1 when he had described the man he most dreaded in the world1
He had said that he 1could hood his eyes like a hawk11  Then I saw
that I had walked straight into the enemy1s headquarters1

My first impulse was to throttle the old ruffian and make for the
open air1  He seemed to anticipate my intention1 for he smiled
gently1 and nodded to the door behind me1

I turned1 and saw two men-servants who had me covered with pistols1

He knew my name1 but he had never seen me before1  And as the
reflection darted across my mind I saw a slender chance1

1I don1t know what you mean11 I said roughly1  1And who are you
calling Richard Hannay1  My name1s Ainslie11

1So11 he said1 still smiling1  1But of course you have others1  We
won1t quarrel about a name11

I was pulling myself together now1 and I reflected that my garb1
lacking coat and waistcoat and collar1 would at any rate not betray
me1  I put on my surliest face and shrugged my shoulders1

1I suppose you1re going to give me up after all1 and I call it a
damned dirty trick1  My God1 I wish I had never seen that cursed
motor-car1  Here1s the money and be damned to you11 and I flung four
sovereigns on the table1

He opened his eyes a little1  1Oh no1 I shall not give you up1  My
friends and I will have a little private settlement with you1 that is
all1  You know a little too much1 Mr Hannay1  You are a clever
actor1 but not quite clever enough11

He spoke with assurance1 but I could see the dawning of a doubt
in his mind1

1Oh1 for God1s sake stop jawing11 I cried1  1Everything1s against
me1  I haven1t had a bit of luck since I came on shore at Leith1
What1s the harm in a poor devil with an empty stomach picking up
some money he finds in a bust-up motor-car1  That1s all I done1 and
for that I1ve been chivvied for two days by those blasted bobbies
over those blasted hills1  I tell you I1m fair sick of it1  You can do
what you like1 old boy1  Ned Ainslie1s got no fight left in him11

I could see that the doubt was gaining1

1Will you oblige me with the story of your recent doings11he asked1
1I can1t1 guv1nor11 I said in a real beggar1s whine1  1I1ve not had a
bite to eat for two days1  Give me a mouthful of food1 and then
you1ll hear God1s truth11

I must have showed my hunger in my face1 for he signalled to
one of the men in the doorway1  A bit of cold pie was brought and a
glass of beer1 and I wolfed them down like a pig--or rather1 like
Ned Ainslie1 for I was keeping up my character1  In the middle of
my meal he spoke suddenly to me in German1 but I turned on him
a face as blank as a stone wall1

Then I told him my story--how I had come off an Archangel
ship at Leith a week ago1 and was making my way overland to my
brother at Wigtown1  I had run short of cash--I hinted vaguely at a
spree--and I was pretty well on my uppers when I had come on a
hole in a hedge1 and1 looking through1 had seen a big motor-car
lying in the burn1  I had poked about to see what had happened1 and
had found three sovereigns lying on the seat and one on the floor1
There was nobody there or any sign of an owner1 so I had pocketed
the cash1  But somehow the law had got after me1  When I had tried
to change a sovereign in a baker1s shop1 the woman had cried on
the police1 and a little later1 when I was washing my face in a burn1
I had been nearly gripped1 and had only got away by leaving my
coat and waistcoat behind me1

1They can have the money back11 I cried1 1for a fat lot of good
it1s done me1  Those perishers are all down on a poor man1  Now1 if
it had been you1 guv1nor1 that had found the quids1 nobody would
have troubled you11

1You1re a good liar1 Hannay11 he said1

I flew into a rage1  1Stop fooling1 damn you1  I tell you my name1s
Ainslie1 and I never heard of anyone called Hannay in my born
days1  I1d sooner have the police than you with your Hannays and
your monkey-faced pistol tricks 111  No1 guv1nor1 I beg pardon1 I
don1t mean that1  I1m much obliged to you for the grub1 and I1ll
thank you to let me go now the coast1s clear11

It was obvious that he was badly puzzled1  You see he had never
seen me1 and my appearance must have altered considerably from
my photographs1 if he had got one of them1  I was pretty smart and
well dressed in London1 and now I was a regular tramp1

1I do not propose to let you go1  If you are what you say you are1
you will soon have a chance of clearing yourself1  If you are what I
believe you are1 I do not think you will see the light much longer11

He rang a bell1 and a third servant appeared from the veranda1

1I want the Lanchester in five minutes11 he said1  1There will be
three to luncheon11

Then he looked steadily at me1 and that was the hardest ordeal
of all1

There was something weird and devilish in those eyes1 cold1
malignant1 unearthly1 and most hellishly clever1  They fascinated me
like the bright eyes of a snake1  I had a strong impulse to throw
myself on his mercy and offer to join his side1 and if you consider
the way I felt about the whole thing you will see that that impulse
must have been purely physical1 the weakness of a brain mesmerized
and mastered by a stronger spirit1  But I managed to stick it out and
even to grin1

1You1ll know me next time1 guv1nor11 I said1

1Karl11 he spoke in German to one of the men in the doorway1
1you will put this fellow in the storeroom till I return1 and you will
be answerable to me for his keeping11

I was marched out of the room with a pistol at each ear1

The storeroom was a damp chamber in what had been the old
farmhouse1  There was no carpet on the uneven floor1 and nothing
to sit down on but a school form1  It was black as pitch1 for the
windows were heavily shuttered1  I made out by groping that the
walls were lined with boxes and barrels and sacks of some heavy
stuff1  The whole place smelt of mould and disuse1  My gaolers
turned the key in the door1 and I could hear them shifting their feet
as they stood on guard outside1

I sat down in that chilly darkness in a very miserable frame of
mind1  The old boy had gone off in a motor to collect the two
ruffians who had interviewed me yesterday1  Now1 they had seen me
as the roadman1 and they would remember me1 for I was in the
same rig1  What was a roadman doing twenty miles from his beat1
pursued by the police1  A question or two would put them on the
track1  Probably they had seen Mr Turnbull1 probably Marmie too;
most likely they could link me up with Sir Harry1 and then the
whole thing would be crystal clear1  What chance had I in this
moorland house with three desperadoes and their armed servants1

I began to think wistfully of the police1 now plodding over the
hills after my wraith1  They at any rate were fellow-countrymen and
honest men1 and their tender mercies would be kinder than these
ghoulish aliens1  But they wouldn1t have listened to me1  That old
devil with the eyelids had not taken long to get rid of them1  I
thought he probably had some kind of graft with the constabulary1
Most likely he had letters from Cabinet Ministers saying he was to
be given every facility for plotting against Britain1  That1s the sort
of owlish way we run our politics in the Old Country1

The three would be back for lunch1 so I hadn1t more than a
couple of hours to wait1  It was simply waiting on destruction1 for I
could see no way out of this mess1  I wished that I had Scudder1s
courage1 for I am free to confess I didn1t feel any great fortitude1
The only thing that kept me going was that I was pretty furious1  It
made me boil with rage to think of those three spies getting the
pull on me like this1  I hoped that at any rate I might be able to
twist one of their necks before they downed me1

The more I thought of it the angrier I grew1 and I had to get up
and move about the room1  I tried the shutters1 but they were the
kind that lock with a key1 and I couldn1t move them1  From the
outside came the faint clucking of hens in the warm sun1  Then I
groped among the sacks and boxes1  I couldn1t open the latter1 and
the sacks seemed to be full of things like dog-biscuits that smelt of
cinnamon1  But1 as I circumnavigated the room1 I found a handle in
the wall which seemed worth investigating1

It was the door of a wall cupboard--what they call a 1press1 in
Scotland--and it was locked1  I shook it1 and it seemed rather
flimsy1  For want of something better to do I put out my strength
on that door1 getting some purchase on the handle by looping my
braces round it1  Presently the thing gave with a crash which I
thought would bring in my warders to inquire1  I waited for a bit1
and then started to explore the cupboard shelves1

There was a multitude of queer things there1  I found an odd
vesta or two in my trouser pockets and struck a light1  It was out in
a second1 but it showed me one thing1  There was a little stock of
electric torches on one shelf1  I picked up one1 and found it was in
working order1

With the torch to help me I investigated further1  There were
bottles and cases of queer-smelling stuffs1 chemicals no doubt for
experiments1 and there were coils of fine copper wire and yanks and
yanks of thin oiled silk1  There was a box of detonators1 and a lot of
cord for fuses1  Then away at the back of the shelf I found a stout
brown cardboard box1 and inside it a wooden case1  I managed to
wrench it open1 and within lay half a dozen little grey bricks1 each a
couple of inches square1

I took up one1 and found that it crumbled easily in my hand1  Then I
smelt it and put my tongue to it1  After that I sat down to think1
I hadn1t been a mining engineer for nothing1 and I knew lentonite
when I saw it1

With one of these bricks I could blow the house to smithereens1
I had used the stuff in Rhodesia and knew its power1  But the
trouble was that my knowledge wasn1t exact1  I had forgotten the
proper charge and the right way of preparing it1 and I wasn1t sure
about the timing1  I had only a vague notion1 too1 as to its power1
for though I had used it I had not handled it with my own fingers1

But it was a chance1 the only possible chance1  It was a mighty
risk1 but against it was an absolute black certainty1  If I used it the
odds were1 as I reckoned1 about five to one in favour of my
blowing myself into the tree-tops; but if I didn1t I should very
likely be occupying a six-foot hole in the garden by the evening1
That was the way I had to look at it1  The prospect was pretty dark
either way1 but anyhow there was a chance1 both for myself and for
my country1

The remembrance of little Scudder decided me1  It was about the
beastliest moment of my life1 for I1m no good at these cold-blooded
resolutions1  Still I managed to rake up the pluck to set my teeth
and choke back the horrid doubts that flooded in on me1  I simply
shut off my mind and pretended I was doing an experiment as
simple as Guy Fawkes fireworks1

I got a detonator1 and fixed it to a couple of feet of fuse1  Then I
took a quarter of a lentonite brick1 and buried it near the door
below one of the sacks in a crack of the floor1 fixing the detonator
in it1  For all I knew half those boxes might be dynamite1  If the
cupboard held such deadly explosives1 why not the boxes1  In that
case there would be a glorious skyward journey for me and the
German servants and about an acre of surrounding country1  There
was also the risk that the detonation might set off the other bricks
in the cupboard1 for I had forgotten most that I knew about
lentonite1  But it didn1t do to begin thinking about the possibilities1
The odds were horrible1 but I had to take them1

I ensconced myself just below the sill of the window1 and lit the
fuse1  Then I waited for a moment or two1  There was dead silence--
only a shuffle of heavy boots in the passage1 and the peaceful cluck
of hens from the warm out-of-doors1  I commended my soul to my
Maker1 and wondered where I would be in five seconds 111

A great wave of heat seemed to surge upwards from the floor1
and hang for a blistering instant in the air1  Then the wall opposite
me flashed into a golden yellow and dissolved with a rending
thunder that hammered my brain into a pulp1  Something dropped
on me1 catching the point of my left shoulder1

And then I think I became unconscious1

My stupor can scarcely have lasted beyond a few seconds1  I felt
myself being choked by thick yellow fumes1 and struggled out of
the debris to my feet1  Somewhere behind me I felt fresh air1  The
jambs of the window had fallen1 and through the ragged rent the
smoke was pouring out to the summer noon1  I stepped over the
broken lintel1 and found myself standing in a yard in a dense and
acrid fog1  I felt very sick and ill1 but I could move my limbs1 and I
staggered blindly forward away from the house1

A small mill-lade ran in a wooden aqueduct at the other side of
the yard1 and into this I fell1  The cool water revived me1 and I had
just enough wits left to think of escape1  I squirmed up the lade
among the slippery green slime till I reached the mill-wheel1  Then I
wriggled through the axle hole into the old mill and tumbled on to
a bed of chaff1  A nail caught the seat of my trousers1 and I left a
wisp of heather-mixture behind me1

The mill had been long out of use1  The ladders were rotten with
age1 and in the loft the rats had gnawed great holes in the floor1
Nausea shook me1 and a wheel in my head kept turning1 while my
left shoulder and arm seemed to be stricken with the palsy1  I looked
out of the window and saw a fog still hanging over the house and
smoke escaping from an upper window1  Please God I had set the
place on fire1 for I could hear confused cries coming from the
other side1

But I had no time to linger1 since this mill was obviously a bad
hiding-place1  Anyone looking for me would naturally follow the
lade1 and I made certain the search would begin as soon as they
found that my body was not in the storeroom1  From another
window I saw that on the far side of the mill stood an old stone
dovecot1  If I could get there without leaving tracks I might find a
hiding-place1 for I argued that my enemies1 if they thought I could
move1 would conclude I had made for open country1 and would go
seeking me on the moor1

I crawled down the broken ladder1 scattering chaff behind me to
cover my footsteps1  I did the same on the mill floor1 and on the
threshold where the door hung on broken hinges1  Peeping out1 I
saw that between me and the dovecot was a piece of bare cobbled
ground1 where no footmarks would show1  Also it was mercifully
hid by the mill buildings from any view from the house1  I slipped
across the space1 got to the back of the dovecot and prospected a
way of ascent1

That was one of the hardest jobs I ever took on1  My shoulder
and arm ached like hell1 and I was so sick and giddy that I was
always on the verge of falling1  But I managed it somehow1  By the
use of out-jutting stones and gaps in the masonry and a tough ivy
root I got to the top in the end1  There was a little parapet behind
which I found space to lie down1  Then I proceeded to go off into
an old-fashioned swoon1

I woke with a burning head and the sun glaring in my face1  For a
long time I lay motionless1 for those horrible fumes seemed to have
loosened my joints and dulled my brain1  Sounds came to me from
the house--men speaking throatily and the throbbing of a stationary
car1  There was a little gap in the parapet to which I wriggled1 and
from which I had some sort of prospect of the yard1  I saw figures
come out--a servant with his head bound up1 and then a younger
man in knickerbockers1  They were looking for something1 and
moved towards the mill1  Then one of them caught sight of the wisp
of cloth on the nail1 and cried out to the other1  They both went
back to the house1 and brought two more to look at it1  I saw the
rotund figure of my late captor1 and I thought I made out the man
with the lisp1  I noticed that all had pistols1

For half an hour they ransacked the mill1  I could hear them
kicking over the barrels and pulling up the rotten planking1  Then
they came outside1 and stood just below the dovecot arguing
fiercely1  The servant with the bandage was being soundly rated1  I
heard them fiddling with the door of the dovecote and for one
horrid moment I fancied they were coming up1  Then they thought
better of it1 and went back to the house1

All that long blistering afternoon I lay baking on the rooftop1
Thirst was my chief torment1  My tongue was like a stick1 and to
make it worse I could hear the cool drip of water from the mill-
lade1  I watched the course of the little stream as it came in from the
moor1 and my fancy followed it to the top of the glen1 where it
must issue from an icy fountain fringed with cool ferns and mosses1
I would have given a thousand pounds to plunge my face into that1

I had a fine prospect of the whole ring of moorland1  I saw the
car speed away with two occupants1 and a man on a hill pony
riding east1  I judged they were looking for me1 and I wished them
joy of their quest1

But I saw something else more interesting1  The house stood
almost on the summit of a swell of moorland which crowned a sort
of plateau1 and there was no higher point nearer than the big hills
six miles off1  The actual summit1 as I have mentioned1 was a
biggish clump of trees--firs mostly1 with a few ashes and beeches1
On the dovecot I was almost on a level with the tree-tops1 and
could see what lay beyond1  The wood was not solid1 but only a
ring1 and inside was an oval of green turf1 for all the world like a
big cricket-field1

I didn1t take long to guess what it was1  It was an aerodrome1 and
a secret one1  The place had been most cunningly chosen1  For
suppose anyone were watching an aeroplane descending here1 he
would think it had gone over the hill beyond the trees1  As the place
was on the top of a rise in the midst of a big amphitheatre1 any
observer from any direction would conclude it had passed out of
view behind the hill1  Only a man very close at hand would realize
that the aeroplane had not gone over but had descended in the
midst of the wood1  An observer with a telescope on one of the
higher hills might have discovered the truth1 but only herds went
there1 and herds do not carry spy-glasses1  When I looked from the
dovecot I could see far away a blue line which I knew was the sea1
and I grew furious to think that our enemies had this secret
conning-tower to rake our waterways1

Then I reflected that if that aeroplane came back the chances
were ten to one that I would be discovered1  So through the afternoon
I lay and prayed for the coming of darkness1 and glad I was
when the sun went down over the big western hills and the twilight
haze crept over the moor1  The aeroplane was late1  The gloaming
was far advanced when I heard the beat of wings and saw it volplaning
downward to its home in the wood1  Lights twinkled for a
bit and there was much coming and going from the house1  Then
the dark fell1 and silence1

Thank God it was a black night1  The moon was well on its last
quarter and would not rise till late1  My thirst was too great to allow
me to tarry1 so about nine o1clock1 so far as I could judge1 I started
to descend1  It wasn1t easy1 and half-way down I heard the back door
of the house open1 and saw the gleam of a lantern against the mill
wall1  For some agonizing minutes I hung by the ivy and prayed
that whoever it was would not come round by the dovecot1  Then
the light disappeared1 and I dropped as softly as I could on to the
hard soil of the yard1

I crawled on my belly in the lee of a stone dyke till I reached the
fringe of trees which surrounded the house1  If I had known how to
do it I would have tried to put that aeroplane out of action1 but I
realized that any attempt would probably be futile1  I was pretty
certain that there would be some kind of defence round the house1
so I went through the wood on hands and knees1 feeling carefully
every inch before me1  It was as well1 for presently I came on a wire
about two feet from the ground1  If I had tripped over that1 it
would doubtless have rung some bell in the house and I would
have been captured1

A hundred yards farther on I found another wire cunningly
placed on the edge of a small stream1  Beyond that lay the moor1 and
in five minutes I was deep in bracken and heather1  Soon I was
round the shoulder of the rise1 in the little glen from which the
mill-lade flowed1  Ten minutes later my face was in the spring1 and I
was soaking down pints of the blessed water1

But I did not stop till I had put half a dozen miles between me
and that accursed dwelling1


CHAPTER SEVEN
The Dry-Fly Fisherman


I sat down on a hill-top and took stock of my position1  I wasn1t
feeling very happy1 for my natural thankfulness at my escape was
clouded by my severe bodily discomfort1  Those lentonite fumes had
fairly poisoned me1 and the baking hours on the dovecot hadn1t
helped matters1  I had a crushing headache1 and felt as sick as a cat1
Also my shoulder was in a bad way1  At first I thought it was only a
bruise1 but it seemed to be swelling1 and I had no use of my left arm1

My plan was to seek Mr Turnbull1s cottage1 recover my garments1
and especially Scudder1s note-book1 and then make for the main
line and get back to the south1  It seemed to me that the sooner I
got in touch with the Foreign Office man1 Sir Walter Bullivant1 the
better1  I didn1t see how I could get more proof than I had got
already1  He must just take or leave my story1 and anyway1 with him
I would be in better hands than those devilish Germans1  I had
begun to feel quite kindly towards the British police1

It was a wonderful starry night1 and I had not much difficulty
about the road1  Sir Harry1s map had given me the lie of the land1
and all I had to do was to steer a point or two west of south-west
to come to the stream where I had met the roadman1  In all these
travels I never knew the names of the places1 but I believe this
stream was no less than the upper waters of the river Tweed1  I
calculated I must be about eighteen miles distant1 and that meant I
could not get there before morning1  So I must lie up a day somewhere1
for I was too outrageous a figure to be seen in the sunlight1
I had neither coat1 waistcoat1 collar1 nor hat1 my trousers were
badly torn1 and my face and hands were black with the explosion1  I
daresay I had other beauties1 for my eyes felt as if they were
furiously bloodshot1  Altogether I was no spectacle for God-fearing
citizens to see on a highroad1

Very soon after daybreak I made an attempt to clean myself in a
hill burn1 and then approached a herd1s cottage1 for I was feeling
the need of food1  The herd was away from home1 and his wife was
alone1 with no neighbour for five miles1  She was a decent old body1
and a plucky one1 for though she got a fright when she saw me1 she
had an axe handy1 and would have used it on any evil-doer1  I told
her that I had had a fall--I didn1t say how--and she saw by my
looks that I was pretty sick1  Like a true Samaritan she asked no
questions1 but gave me a bowl of milk with a dash of whisky in it1
and let me sit for a little by her kitchen fire1  She would have bathed
my shoulder1 but it ached so badly that I would not let her touch it1

I don1t know what she took me for--a repentant burglar1
perhaps; for when I wanted to pay her for the milk and tendered a
sovereign which was the smallest coin I had1 she shook her head
and said something about 1giving it to them that had a right to it11
At this I protested so strongly that I think she believed me honest1
for she took the money and gave me a warm new plaid for it1 and
an old hat of her man1s1  She showed me how to wrap the plaid
around my shoulders1 and when I left that cottage I was the living
image of the kind of Scotsman you see in the illustrations to
Burns1s poems1  But at any rate I was more or less clad1

It was as well1 for the weather changed before midday to a thick
drizzle of rain1  I found shelter below an overhanging rock in the
crook of a burn1 where a drift of dead brackens made a tolerable
bed1  There I managed to sleep till nightfall1 waking very cramped
and wretched1 with my shoulder gnawing like a toothache1  I ate the
oatcake and cheese the old wife had given me and set out again just
before the darkening1

I pass over the miseries of that night among the wet hills1  There
were no stars to steer by1 and I had to do the best I could from my
memory of the map1  Twice I lost my way1 and I had some nasty
falls into peat-bogs1  I had only about ten miles to go as the crow
flies1 but my mistakes made it nearer twenty1  The last bit was
completed with set teeth and a very light and dizzy head1  But I
managed it1 and in the early dawn I was knocking at Mr Turnbull1s
door1  The mist lay close and thick1 and from the cottage I could
not see the highroad1

Mr Turnbull himself opened to me--sober and something more
than sober1  He was primly dressed in an ancient but well-tended
suit of black; he had been shaved not later than the night before; he
wore a linen collar; and in his left hand he carried a pocket Bible1
At first he did not recognize me1

1Whae are ye that comes stravaigin1 here on the Sabbath mornin111
he asked1

I had lost all count of the days1  So the Sabbath was the reason
for this strange decorum1

My head was swimming so wildly that I could not frame a
coherent answer1  But he recognized me1 and he saw that I was ill1

1Hae ye got my specs11 he asked1

I fetched them out of my trouser pocket and gave him them1

1Ye1ll hae come for your jaicket and westcoat11 he said1  1Come in-
bye1  Losh1 man1 ye1re terrible dune i1 the legs1  Haud up till I get ye
to a chair11

I perceived I was in for a bout of malaria1  I had a good deal of
fever in my bones1 and the wet night had brought it out1 while my
shoulder and the effects of the fumes combined to make me feel
pretty bad1  Before I knew1 Mr Turnbull was helping me off with
my clothes1 and putting me to bed in one of the two cupboards that
lined the kitchen walls1

He was a true friend in need1 that old roadman1  His wife was
dead years ago1 and since his daughter1s marriage he lived alone1

For the better part of ten days he did all the rough nursing I
needed1  I simply wanted to be left in peace while the fever took its
course1 and when my skin was cool again I found that the bout had
more or less cured my shoulder1  But it was a baddish go1 and
though I was out of bed in five days1 it took me some time to get
my legs again1

He went out each morning1 leaving me milk for the day1 and
locking the door behind him; and came in in the evening to sit
silent in the chimney corner1  Not a soul came near the place1  When
I was getting better1 he never bothered me with a question1  Several
times he fetched me a two days1 old SCOTSMAN1 and I noticed that the
interest in the Portland Place murder seemed to have died down1
There was no mention of it1 and I could find very little about
anything except a thing called the General Assembly--some
ecclesiastical spree1 I gathered1

One day he produced my belt from a lockfast drawer1  1There1s a
terrible heap o1 siller in1t11 he said1  1Ye1d better coont it to see
it1s a1 there11

He never even sought my name1  I asked him if anybody had
been around making inquiries subsequent to my spell at the road-making1

1Ay1 there was a man in a motor-cawr1  He speired whae had ta1en
my place that day1 and I let on I thocht him daft1  But he keepit on
at me1 and syne I said he maun be thinkin1 o1 my gude-brither frae
the Cleuch that whiles lent me a haun11  He was a wersh-lookin1
sowl1 and I couldna understand the half o1 his English tongue11

I was getting restless those last days1 and as soon as I felt myself
fit I decided to be off1  That was not till the twelfth day of June1
and as luck would have it a drover went past that morning taking
some cattle to Moffat1  He was a man named Hislop1 a friend of
Turnbull1s1 and he came in to his breakfast with us and offered to
take me with him1

I made Turnbull accept five pounds for my lodging1 and a hard
job I had of it1  There never was a more independent being1  He
grew positively rude when I pressed him1 and shy and red1 and
took the money at last without a thank you1  When I told him how
much I owed him1 he grunted something about 1ae guid turn
deservin1 anither11  You would have thought from our leave-taking
that we had parted in disgust1

Hislop was a cheery soul1 who chattered all the way over the pass
and down the sunny vale of Annan1  I talked of Galloway markets
and sheep prices1 and he made up his mind I was a 1pack-shepherd1
from those parts--whatever that may be1  My plaid and my old hat1
as I have said1 gave me a fine theatrical Scots look1  But driving
cattle is a mortally slow job1 and we took the better part of the day
to cover a dozen miles1

If I had not had such an anxious heart I would have enjoyed that
time1  It was shining blue weather1 with a constantly changing
prospect of brown hills and far green meadows1 and a continual
sound of larks and curlews and falling streams1  But I had no mind
for the summer1 and little for Hislop1s conversation1 for as the
fateful fifteenth of June drew near I was overweighed with the
hopeless difficulties of my enterprise1

I got some dinner in a humble Moffat public-house1 and walked
the two miles to the junction on the main line1  The night express
for the south was not due till near midnight1 and to fill up the time
I went up on the hillside and fell asleep1 for the walk had tired me1
I all but slept too long1 and had to run to the station and catch the
train with two minutes to spare1  The feel of the hard third-class
cushions and the smell of stale tobacco cheered me up wonderfully1
At any rate1 I felt now that I was getting to grips with my job1

I was decanted at Crewe in the small hours and had to wait till six to
get a train for Birmingham1  In the afternoon I got to Reading1 and
changed into a local train which journeyed into the deeps of Berkshire1
Presently I was in a land of lush water-meadows and slow
reedy streams1  About eight o1clock in the evening1 a weary and
travel-stained being--a cross between a farm-labourer and a vet--
with a checked black-and-white plaid over his arm 1for I did not
dare to wear it south of the Border11 descended at the little station
of Artinswell1  There were several people on the platform1 and I
thought I had better wait to ask my way till I was clear of the place1

The road led through a wood of great beeches and then into a
shallow valley1 with the green backs of downs peeping over the
distant trees1  After Scotland the air smelt heavy and flat1 but
infinitely sweet1 for the limes and chestnuts and lilac bushes were domes
of blossom1  Presently I came to a bridge1 below which a clear slow
stream flowed between snowy beds of water-buttercups1  A little
above it was a mill; and the lasher made a pleasant cool sound in
the scented dusk1  Somehow the place soothed me and put me at my
ease1  I fell to whistling as I looked into the green depths1 and the
tune which came to my lips was 1Annie Laurie11

A fisherman came up from the waterside1 and as he neared me he
too began to whistle1  The tune was infectious1 for he followed my
suit1  He was a huge man in untidy old flannels and a wide-brimmed
hat1 with a canvas bag slung on his shoulder1  He nodded to me1
and I thought I had never seen a shrewder or better-tempered face1
He leaned his delicate ten-foot split-cane rod against the bridge1
and looked with me at the water1

1Clear1 isn1t it11 he said pleasantly1  1I back our Kenner any day
against the Test1  Look at that big fellow1  Four pounds if he1s an
ounce1  But the evening rise is over and you can1t tempt 1em11

1I don1t see him11 said I1

1Look1  There1  A yard from the reeds just above that stickle11

1I1ve got him now1  You might swear he was a black stone11

1So11 he said1 and whistled another bar of 1Annie Laurie11

1Twisdon1s the name1 isn1t it11 he said over his shoulder1 his eyes
still fixed on the stream1

1No11 I said1  1I mean to say1 Yes11  I had forgotten all about
my alias1

1It1s a wise conspirator that knows his own name11 he observed1
grinning broadly at a moor-hen that emerged from the bridge1s shadow1

I stood up and looked at him1 at the square1 cleft jaw and broad1
lined brow and the firm folds of cheek1 and began to think that
here at last was an ally worth having1  His whimsical blue eyes
seemed to go very deep1

Suddenly he frowned1  1I call it disgraceful11 he said1 raising his
voice1  1Disgraceful that an able-bodied man like you should dare to
beg1  You can get a meal from my kitchen1 but you1ll get no money
from me11

A dog-cart was passing1 driven by a young man who raised his
whip to salute the fisherman1  When he had gone1 he picked up his rod1

1That1s my house11 he said1 pointing to a white gate a hundred
yards on1  1Wait five minutes and then go round to the back door11
And with that he left me1

I did as I was bidden1  I found a pretty cottage with a lawn
running down to the stream1 and a perfect jungle of guelder-rose
and lilac flanking the path1  The back door stood open1 and a grave
butler was awaiting me1

1Come this way1 Sir11 he said1 and he led me along a passage and
up a back staircase to a pleasant bedroom looking towards the
river1  There I found a complete outfit laid out for me--dress
clothes with all the fixings1 a brown flannel suit1 shirts1 collars1 ties1
shaving things and hair-brushes1 even a pair of patent shoes1  1Sir
Walter thought as how Mr Reggie1s things would fit you1 Sir11 said
the butler1  1He keeps some clothes 1ere1 for he comes regular on the
week-ends1  There1s a bathroom next door1 and I1ve prepared a 1ot
bath1  Dinner in 1alf an hour1 Sir1  You1ll 1ear the gong11

The grave being withdrew1 and I sat down in a chintz-covered
easy-chair and gaped1  It was like a pantomime1 to come suddenly out
of beggardom into this orderly comfort1  Obviously Sir Walter
believed in me1 though why he did I could not guess1  I looked at
myself in the mirror and saw a wild1 haggard brown fellow1 with a
fortnight1s ragged beard1 and dust in ears and eyes1 collarless1
vulgarly shirted1 with shapeless old tweed clothes and boots that
had not been cleaned for the better part of a month1  I made a fine
tramp and a fair drover; and here I was ushered by a prim butler
into this temple of gracious ease1  And the best of it was that they
did not even know my name1

I resolved not to puzzle my head but to take the gifts the gods
had provided1  I shaved and bathed luxuriously1 and got into the
dress clothes and clean crackling shirt1 which fitted me not so
badly1  By the time I had finished the looking-glass showed a not
unpersonable young man1

Sir Walter awaited me in a dusky dining-room where a little
round table was lit with silver candles1  The sight of him--so
respectable and established and secure1 the embodiment of law and
government and all the conventions--took me aback and made me
feel an interloper1  He couldn1t know the truth about me1 or he
wouldn1t treat me like this1  I simply could not accept his hospitality
on false pretences1

1I1m more obliged to you than I can say1 but I1m bound to make
things clear11 I said1  1I1m an innocent man1 but I1m wanted by the
police1  I1ve got to tell you this1 and I won1t be surprised if you kick
me out11

He smiled1  1That1s all right1  Don1t let that interfere with your
appetite1  We can talk about these things after dinner11
I never ate a meal with greater relish1 for I had had nothing all
day but railway sandwiches1  Sir Walter did me proud1 for we drank
a good champagne and had some uncommon fine port afterwards1
it made me almost hysterical to be sitting there1 waited on by a
footman and a sleek butler1 and remember that I had been living
for three weeks like a brigand1 with every man1s hand against me1  I
told Sir Walter about tiger-fish in the Zambesi that bite off your
fingers if you give them a chance1 and we discussed sport up and
down the globe1 for he had hunted a bit in his day1

We went to his study for coffee1 a jolly room full of books and
trophies and untidiness and comfort1  I made up my mind that if
ever I got rid of this business and had a house of my own1 I would
create just such a room1  Then when the coffee-cups were cleared
away1 and we had got our cigars alight1 my host swung his long
legs over the side of his chair and bade me get started with my yarn1

1I1ve obeyed Harry1s instructions11 he said1 1and the bribe he
offered me was that you would tell me something to wake me up1
I1m ready1 Mr Hannay11

I noticed with a start that he called me by my proper name1

I began at the very beginning1  I told of my boredom in London1
and the night I had come back to find Scudder gibbering on my
doorstep1  I told him all Scudder had told me about Karolides and
the Foreign Office conference1 and that made him purse his lips and grin1

Then I got to the murder1 and he grew solemn again1  He heard
all about the milkman and my time in Galloway1 and my deciphering
Scudder1s notes at the inn1

1You1ve got them here11 he asked sharply1 and drew a long
breath when I whipped the little book from my pocket1

I said nothing of the contents1  Then I described my meeting
with Sir Harry1 and the speeches at the hall1  At that he laughed
uproariously1

1Harry talked dashed nonsense1 did he1  I quite believe it1  He1s as
good a chap as ever breathed1 but his idiot of an uncle has stuffed
his head with maggots1  Go on1 Mr Hannay11

My day as roadman excited him a bit1  He made me describe the
two fellows in the car very closely1 and seemed to be raking back in
his memory1  He grew merry again when he heard of the fate of that
ass jopley1

But the old man in the moorland house solemnized him1  Again I
had to describe every detail of his appearance1

1Bland and bald-headed and hooded his eyes like a bird 111  He
sounds a sinister wild-fowl1  And you dynamited his hermitage1
after he had saved you from the police1  Spirited piece of work1 that11
Presently I reached the end of my wanderings1  He got up slowly1
and looked down at me from the hearth-rug1

1You may dismiss the police from your mind11 he said1  1You1re in
no danger from the law of this land11

1Great Scot11 I cried1  1Have they got the murderer11

1No1  But for the last fortnight they have dropped you from the
list of possibles11

1Why11 I asked in amazement1

1Principally because I received a letter from Scudder1  I knew
something of the man1 and he did several jobs for me1  He was half
crank1 half genius1 but he was wholly honest1  The trouble about
him was his partiality for playing a lone hand1  That made him
pretty well useless in any Secret Service--a pity1 for he had uncommon
gifts1  I think he was the bravest man in the world1 for he was
always shivering with fright1 and yet nothing would choke him off1
I had a letter from him on the 31st of May11

1But he had been dead a week by then11

1The letter was written and posted on the 23rd1  He evidently did
not anticipate an immediate decease1  His communications usually
took a week to reach me1 for they were sent under cover to Spain
and then to Newcastle1  He had a mania1 you know1 for concealing
his tracks11

1What did he say11 I stammered1

1Nothing1  Merely that he was in danger1 but had found shelter
with a good friend1 and that I would hear from him before the 15th
of June1  He gave me no address1 but said he was living near
Portland Place1  I think his object was to clear you if anything
happened1  When I got it I went to Scotland Yard1 went over the
details of the inquest1 and concluded that you were the friend1  We
made inquiries about you1 Mr Hannay1 and found you were respectable1
I thought I knew the motives for your disappearance--not
only the police1 the other one too--and when I got Harry1s scrawl I
guessed at the rest1  I have been expecting you any time this past week11
You can imagine what a load this took off my mind1  I felt a free
man once more1 for I was now up against my country1s enemies
only1 and not my country1s law1

1Now let us have the little note-book11 said Sir Walter1

It took us a good hour to work through it1  I explained the
cypher1 and he was jolly quick at picking it up1  He emended my
reading of it on several points1 but I had been fairly correct1 on the
whole1  His face was very grave before he had finished1 and he sat
silent for a while1

1I don1t know what to make of it11 he said at last1  1He is right
about one thing--what is going to happen the day after tomorrow1
How the devil can it have got known1  That is ugly enough in itself1
But all this about war and the Black Stone--it reads like some wild
melodrama1  If only I had more confidence in Scudder1s judgement1
The trouble about him was that he was too romantic1  He had the
artistic temperament1 and wanted a story to be better than God
meant it to be1  He had a lot of odd biases1 too1  Jews1 for example1
made him see red1  Jews and the high finance1

1The Black Stone11 he repeated1  1DER SCHWARZE STEIN1  It1s like a
penny novelette1  And all this stuff about Karolides1  That is the
weak part of the tale1 for I happen to know that the virtuous
Karolides is likely to outlast us both1  There is no State in Europe
that wants him gone1  Besides1 he has just been playing up to Berlin
and Vienna and giving my Chief some uneasy moments1  No1  Scudder has
gone off the track there1  Frankly1 Hannay1 I don1t believe that part of
his story1  There1s some nasty business afoot1 and he found out too much
and lost his life over it1  But I am ready to take my oath that it is
ordinary spy work1  A certain great European Power makes a hobby of her
spy system1 and her methods are not too particular1  Since she pays by
piecework her blackguards are not likely to stick at a murder or two1
They want our naval dispositions for their collection at the Marineamt;
but they will be pigeon-holed--nothing more11

Just then the butler entered the room1

1There1s a trunk-call from London1 Sir Walter1  It1s Mr 1Eath1 and
he wants to speak to you personally11

My host went off to the telephone1

He returned in five minutes with a whitish face1  1I apologize to
the shade of Scudder11 he said1  1Karolides was shot dead this evening
at a few minutes after seven11


CHAPTER EIGHT
The Coming of the Black Stone


I came down to breakfast next morning1 after eight hours of blessed
dreamless sleep1 to find Sir Walter decoding a telegram in the midst
of muffins and marmalade1  His fresh rosiness of yesterday seemed a
thought tarnished1

1I had a busy hour on the telephone after you went to bed11 he
said1  1I got my Chief to speak to the First Lord and the Secretary
for War1 and they are bringing Royer over a day sooner1  This wire
clinches it1  He will be in London at five1  Odd that the code word
for a SOUS-CHEF D1ETAT MAJOR-GENERAL should be 1Porker111

He directed me to the hot dishes and went on1

1Not that I think it will do much good1  If your friends were
clever enough to find out the first arrangement they are clever
enough to discover the change1  I would give my head to know
where the leak is1  We believed there were only five men in England
who knew about Royer1s visit1 and you may be certain there were
fewer in France1 for they manage these things better there11

While I ate he continued to talk1 making me to my surprise a
present of his full confidence1

1Can the dispositions not be changed11 I asked1

1They could11 he said1  1But we want to avoid that if possible1
They are the result of immense thought1 and no alteration would be
as good1  Besides1 on one or two points change is simply impossible1
Still1 something could be done1 I suppose1 if it were absolutely
necessary1  But you see the difficulty1 Hannay1  Our enemies are not
going to be such fools as to pick Royer1s pocket or any childish
game like that1  They know that would mean a row and put us on
our guard1  Their aim is to get the details without any one of us
knowing1 so that Royer will go back to Paris in the belief that the
whole business is still deadly secret1  If they can1t do that they fail1
for1 once we suspect1 they know that the whole thing must be altered11

1Then we must stick by the Frenchman1s side till he is home
again11 I said1  1If they thought they could get the information in
Paris they would try there1  It means that they have some deep
scheme on foot in London which they reckon is going to win out11

1Royer dines with my Chief1 and then comes to my house where
four people will see him--Whittaker from the Admiralty1 myself1
Sir Arthur Drew1 and General Winstanley1  The First Lord is ill1
and has gone to Sheringham1  At my house he will get a certain
document from Whittaker1 and after that he will be motored to
Portsmouth where a destroyer will take him to Havre1  His journey
is too important for the ordinary boat-train1  He will never be left
unattended for a moment till he is safe on French soil1  The same
with Whittaker till he meets Royer1  That is the best we can do1 and
it1s hard to see how there can be any miscarriage1  But I don1t mind
admitting that I1m horribly nervous1  This murder of Karolides will
play the deuce in the chancelleries of Europe11

After breakfast he asked me if I could drive a car1
1Well1 you1ll be my chauffeur today and wear Hudson1s rig1
You1re about his size1  You have a hand in this business and we are
taking no risks1  There are desperate men against us1 who will not
respect the country retreat of an overworked official11

When I first came to London I had bought a car and amused
myself with running about the south of England1 so I knew something
of the geography1  I took Sir Walter to town by the Bath
Road and made good going1  It was a soft breathless June morning1
with a promise of sultriness later1 but it was delicious enough
swinging through the little towns with their freshly watered streets1
and past the summer gardens of the Thames valley1  I landed Sir
Walter at his house in Queen Anne1s Gate punctually by half-past
eleven1  The butler was coming up by train with the luggage1

The first thing he did was to take me round to Scotland Yard1
There we saw a prim gentleman1 with a clean-shaven1 lawyer1s face1

1I1ve brought you the Portland Place murderer11 was Sir Walter1s
introduction1

The reply was a wry smile1  1It would have been a welcome
present1 Bullivant1  This1 I presume1 is Mr Richard Hannay1 who for
some days greatly interested my department11

1Mr Hannay will interest it again1  He has much to tell you1 but
not today1  For certain grave reasons his tale must wait for
four hours1  Then1 I can promise you1 you will be entertained and
possibly edified1  I want you to assure Mr Hannay that he will suffer
no further inconvenience11

This assurance was promptly given1  1You can take up your life
where you left off11 I was told1  1Your flat1 which probably you no
longer wish to occupy1 is waiting for you1 and your man is still
there1  As you were never publicly accused1 we considered that there
was no need of a public exculpation1  But on that1 of course1 you
must please yourself11

1We may want your assistance later on1 MacGillivray11 Sir Walter
said as we left1

Then he turned me loose1

1Come and see me tomorrow1 Hannay1  I needn1t tell you to keep
deadly quiet1  If I were you I would go to bed1 for you must have
considerable arrears of sleep to overtake1  You had better lie low1
for if one of your Black Stone friends saw you there might be trouble11

I felt curiously at a loose end1  At first it was very pleasant to be a
free man1 able to go where I wanted without fearing anything1  I
had only been a month under the ban of the law1 and it was quite
enough for me1  I went to the Savoy and ordered very carefully a
very good luncheon1 and then smoked the best cigar the house
could provide1  But I was still feeling nervous1  When I saw anybody
look at me in the lounge1 I grew shy1 and wondered if they were
thinking about the murder1

After that I took a taxi and drove miles away up into North
London1  I walked back through fields and lines of villas and terraces
and then slums and mean streets1 and it took me pretty nearly two
hours1  All the while my restlessness was growing worse1  I felt that
great things1 tremendous things1 were happening or about to
happen1 and I1 who was the cog-wheel of the whole business1 was
out of it1  Royer would be landing at Dover1 Sir Walter would be
making plans with the few people in England who were in the
secret1 and somewhere in the darkness the Black Stone would be
working1  I felt the sense of danger and impending calamity1 and I
had the curious feeling1 too1 that I alone could avert it1 alone could
grapple with it1  But I was out of the game now1  How could it be
otherwise1  It was not likely that Cabinet Ministers and Admiralty
Lords and Generals would admit me to their councils1

I actually began to wish that I could run up against one of my
three enemies1  That would lead to developments1  I felt that I
wanted enormously to have a vulgar scrap with those gentry1 where
I could hit out and flatten something1  I was rapidly getting into a
very bad temper1

I didn1t feel like going back to my flat1  That had to be faced
some time1 but as I still had sufficient money I thought I would put
it off till next morning1 and go to a hotel for the night1

My irritation lasted through dinner1 which I had at a restaurant
in Jermyn Street1  I was no longer hungry1 and let several courses
pass untasted1  I drank the best part of a bottle of Burgundy1 but it
did nothing to cheer me1  An abominable restlessness had taken
possession of me1  Here was I1 a very ordinary fellow1 with no
particular brains1 and yet I was convinced that somehow I was
needed to help this business through--that without me it would all
go to blazes1  I told myself it was sheer silly conceit1 that four or
five of the cleverest people living1 with all the might of the British
Empire at their back1 had the job in hand1  Yet I couldn1t be
convinced1  It seemed as if a voice kept speaking in my ear1 telling
me to be up and doing1 or I would never sleep again1

The upshot was that about half-past nine I made up my mind to
go to Queen Anne1s Gate1  Very likely I would not be admitted1 but
it would ease my conscience to try1

I walked down Jermyn Street1 and at the corner of Duke Street
passed a group of young men1  They were in evening dress1 had
been dining somewhere1 and were going on to a music-hall1  One of
them was Mr Marmaduke jopley1

He saw me and stopped short1

1By God1 the murderer11 he cried1  1Here1 you fellows1 hold him1
That1s Hannay1 the man who did the Portland Place murder11  He
gripped me by the arm1 and the others crowded round1
I wasn1t looking for any trouble1 but my ill-temper made me play
the fool1  A policeman came up1 and I should have told him the
truth1 and1 if he didn1t believe it1 demanded to be taken to Scotland
Yard1 or for that matter to the nearest police station1  But a delay at
that moment seemed to me unendurable1 and the sight of Marmie1s
imbecile face was more than I could bear1  I let out with my left1
and had the satisfaction of seeing him measure his length in the
gutter1

Then began an unholy row1  They were all on me at once1 and
the policeman took me in the rear1  I got in one or two good blows1
for I think1 with fair play1 I could have licked the lot of them1 but
the policeman pinned me behind1 and one of them got his fingers
on my throat1

Through a black cloud of rage I heard the officer of the law
asking what was the matter1 and Marmie1 between his broken teeth1
declaring that I was Hannay the murderer1

1Oh1 damn it all11 I cried1 1make the fellow shut up1  I advise you
to leave me alone1 constable1  Scotland Yard knows all about me1
and you1ll get a proper wigging if you interfere with me11

1You1ve got to come along of me1 young man11 said the policeman1
1I saw you strike that gentleman crool 1ard1  You began it too1
for he wasn1t doing nothing1  I seen you1  Best go quietly or I1ll have
to fix you up11

Exasperation and an overwhelming sense that at no cost must I
delay gave me the strength of a bull elephant1  I fairly wrenched the
constable off his feet1 floored the man who was gripping my collar1
and set off at my best pace down Duke Street1  I heard a whistle
being blown1 and the rush of men behind me1

I have a very fair turn of speed1 and that night I had wings1  In a
jiffy I was in Pall Mall and had turned down towards St James1s
Park1  I dodged the policeman at the Palace gates1 dived through a
press of carriages at the entrance to the Mall1 and was making for
the bridge before my pursuers had crossed the roadway1  In the
open ways of the Park I put on a spurt1  Happily there were few
people about and no one tried to stop me1  I was staking all on
getting to Queen Anne1s Gate1

When I entered that quiet thoroughfare it seemed deserted1  Sir
Walter1s house was in the narrow part1 and outside it three or four
motor-cars were drawn up1  I slackened speed some yards off and
walked briskly up to the door1  If the butler refused me admission1
or if he even delayed to open the door1 I was done1

He didn1t delay1  I had scarcely rung before the door opened1

1I must see Sir Walter11 I panted1  1My business is desperately
important11

That butler was a great man1  Without moving a muscle he held
the door open1 and then shut it behind me1  1Sir Walter is engaged1
Sir1 and I have orders to admit no one1  Perhaps you will wait11

The house was of the old-fashioned kind1 with a wide hall and
rooms on both sides of it1  At the far end was an alcove with a
telephone and a couple of chairs1 and there the butler offered me a seat1

1See here11 I whispered1  1There1s trouble about and I1m in it1  But
Sir Walter knows1 and I1m working for him1  If anyone comes and
asks if I am here1 tell him a lie11

He nodded1 and presently there was a noise of voices in the
street1 and a furious ringing at the bell1  I never admired a man
more than that butler1  He opened the door1 and with a face like a
graven image waited to be questioned1  Then he gave them it1  He
told them whose house it was1 and what his orders were1 and
simply froze them off the doorstep1  I could see it all from my
alcove1 and it was better than any play1

I hadn1t waited long till there came another ring at the bell1  The
butler made no bones about admitting this new visitor1

While he was taking off his coat I saw who it was1  You couldn1t
open a newspaper or a magazine without seeing that face--the grey
beard cut like a spade1 the firm fighting mouth1 the blunt square
nose1 and the keen blue eyes1  I recognized the First Sea Lord1 the
man1 they say1 that made the new British Navy1

He passed my alcove and was ushered into a room at the back of
the hall1  As the door opened I could hear the sound of low voices1
It shut1 and I was left alone again1

For twenty minutes I sat there1 wondering what I was to do
next1  I was still perfectly convinced that I was wanted1 but when or
how I had no notion1  I kept looking at my watch1 and as the time
crept on to half-past ten I began to think that the conference must
soon end1  In a quarter of an hour Royer should be speeding along
the road to Portsmouth 111

Then I heard a bell ring1 and the butler appeared1  The door of
the back room opened1 and the First Sea Lord came out1  He walked
past me1 and in passing he glanced in my direction1 and for a
second we looked each other in the face1

Only for a second1 but it was enough to make my heart jump1  I
had never seen the great man before1 and he had never seen me1
But in that fraction of time something sprang into his eyes1 and that
something was recognition1  You can1t mistake it1  It is a flicker1 a
spark of light1 a minute shade of difference which means one thing
and one thing only1  It came involuntarily1 for in a moment it died1
and he passed on1  In a maze of wild fancies I heard the street door
close behind him1

I picked up the telephone book and looked up the number of his
house1  We were connected at once1 and I heard a servant1s voice1

1Is his Lordship at home11 I asked1

1His Lordship returned half an hour ago11 said the voice1 1and has
gone to bed1  He is not very well tonight1  Will you leave a
message1 Sir11

I rang off and almost tumbled into a chair1  My part in this
business was not yet ended1  It had been a close shave1 but I had
been in time1

Not a moment could be lost1 so I marched boldly to the door of
that back room and entered without knocking1

Five surprised faces looked up from a round table1  There was
Sir Walter1 and Drew the War Minister1 whom I knew from his
photographs1  There was a slim elderly man1 who was probably
Whittaker1 the Admiralty official1 and there was General Winstanley1
conspicuous from the long scar on his forehead1  Lastly1
there was a short stout man with an iron-grey moustache and
bushy eyebrows1 who had been arrested in the middle of a sentence1

Sir Walter1s face showed surprise and annoyance1

1This is Mr Hannay1 of whom I have spoken to you11 he said
apologetically to the company1  1I1m afraid1 Hannay1 this visit
is ill-timed11

I was getting back my coolness1  1That remains to be seen1 Sir11 I
said; 1but I think it may be in the nick of time1  For God1s sake1
gentlemen1 tell me who went out a minute ago11

1Lord Alloa11 Sir Walter said1 reddening with anger1
1It was not11 I cried; 1it was his living image1 but it was not Lord
Alloa1  It was someone who recognized me1 someone I have seen in
the last month1  He had scarcely left the doorstep when I rang up
Lord Alloa1s house and was told he had come in half an hour
before and had gone to bed11

1Who--who--1 someone stammered1

1The Black Stone11 I cried1 and I sat down in the chair so recently
vacated and looked round at five badly scared gentlemen1


CHAPTER NINE
The Thirty-Nine Steps


1Nonsense11 said the official from the Admiralty1

Sir Walter got up and left the room while we looked blankly at
the table1  He came back in ten minutes with a long face1  1I have
spoken to Alloa11 he said1  1Had him out of bed--very grumpy1  He
went straight home after Mulross1s dinner11

1But it1s madness11 broke in General Winstanley1  1Do you mean
to tell me that that man came here and sat beside me for the best
part of half an hour and that I didn1t detect the imposture1  Alloa
must be out of his mind11

1Don1t you see the cleverness of it11 I said1  1You were too
interested in other things to have any eyes1  You took Lord Alloa for
granted1  If it had been anybody else you might have looked more
closely1 but it was natural for him to be here1 and that put you all
to sleep11

Then the Frenchman spoke1 very slowly and in good English1

1The young man is right1  His psychology is good1  Our enemies
have not been foolish11

He bent his wise brows on the assembly1

1I will tell you a tale11 he said1  1It happened many years ago in
Senegal1  I was quartered in a remote station1 and to pass the time
used to go fishing for big barbel in the river1  A little Arab mare
used to carry my luncheon basket--one of the salted dun breed you
got at Timbuctoo in the old days1  Well1 one morning I had good
sport1 and the mare was unaccountably restless1  I could hear her
whinnying and squealing and stamping her feet1 and I kept soothing
her with my voice while my mind was intent on fish1  I could see
her all the time1 as I thought1 out of a corner of my eye1 tethered
to a tree twenty yards away1  After a couple of hours I began to
think of food1  I collected my fish in a tarpaulin bag1 and moved
down the stream towards the mare1 trolling my line1  When I got up
to her I flung the tarpaulin on her back--1

He paused and looked round1

1It was the smell that gave me warning1  I turned my head and
found myself looking at a lion three feet off 111  An old man-eater1
that was the terror of the village 111  What was left of the mare1 a
mass of blood and bones and hide1 was behind him11

1What happened11 I asked1  I was enough of a hunter to know a
true yarn when I heard it1

1I stuffed my fishing-rod into his jaws1 and I had a pistol1  Also
my servants came presently with rifles1  But he left his mark on me11
He held up a hand which lacked three fingers1

1Consider11 he said1  1The mare had been dead more than an hour1
and the brute had been patiently watching me ever since1  I never
saw the kill1 for I was accustomed to the mare1s fretting1 and I
never marked her absence1 for my consciousness of her was only of
something tawny1 and the lion filled that part1  If I could blunder
thus1 gentlemen1 in a land where men1s senses are keen1 why should
we busy preoccupied urban folk not err also11

Sir Walter nodded1  No one was ready to gainsay him1

1But I don1t see11 went on Winstanley1  1Their object was to get
these dispositions without our knowing it1  Now it only required
one of us to mention to Alloa our meeting tonight for the whole
fraud to be exposed11

Sir Walter laughed dryly1  1The selection of Alloa shows their
acumen1  Which of us was likely to speak to him about tonight1  Or
was he likely to open the subject11

I remembered the First Sea Lord1s reputation for taciturnity and
shortness of temper1

1The one thing that puzzles me11 said the General1 1is what good
his visit here would do that spy fellow1  He could not carry away
several pages of figures and strange names in his head11

1That is not difficult11 the Frenchman replied1  1A good spy is
trained to have a photographic memory1  Like your own Macaulay1
You noticed he said nothing1 but went through these papers again
and again1  I think we may assume that he has every detail stamped
on his mind1  When I was younger I could do the same trick11

1Well1 I suppose there is nothing for it but to change the plans11
said Sir Walter ruefully1

Whittaker was looking very glum1  1Did you tell Lord Alloa what
has happened11 he asked1  1No1  Well1 I can1t speak with absolute
assurance1 but I1m nearly certain we can1t make any serious change
unless we alter the geography of England11

1Another thing must be said11 it was Royer who spoke1  1I talked
freely when that man was here1  I told something of the military
plans of my Government1  I was permitted to say so much1  But that
information would be worth many millions to our enemies1  No1 my
friends1 I see no other way1  The man who came here and his
confederates must be taken1 and taken at once11

1Good God11 I cried1 1and we have not a rag of a clue11

1Besides11 said Whittaker1 1there is the post1  By this time the news
will be on its way11

1No11 said the Frenchman1  1You do not understand the habits
of the spy1  He receives personally his reward1 and he delivers
personally his intelligence1  We in France know something of the
breed1  There is still a chance1 MES AMIS1  These men must cross
the sea1 and there are ships to be searched and ports to be
watched1  Believe me1 the need is desperate for both France and Britain11

Royer1s grave good sense seemed to pull us together1  He was the
man of action among fumblers1  But I saw no hope in any face1 and
I felt none1  Where among the fifty millions of these islands and
within a dozen hours were we to lay hands on the three cleverest
rogues in Europe1

Then suddenly I had an inspiration1

1Where is Scudder1s book11 I cried to Sir Walter1  1Quick1 man1 I
remember something in it11

He unlocked the door of a bureau and gave it to me1

I found the place1  THIRTY-NINE STEPS1 I read1 and again1 THIRTY-NINE
STEPS--I COUNTED THEM--HIGH TIDE 10117 P1M1

The Admiralty man was looking at me as if he thought I had
gone mad1

1Don1t you see it1s a clue11 I shouted1  1Scudder knew where these
fellows laired--he knew where they were going to leave the
country1 though he kept the name to himself1  Tomorrow was the
day1 and it was some place where high tide was at 1011711

1They may have gone tonight11 someone said1

1Not they1  They have their own snug secret way1 and they won1t
be hurried1  I know Germans1 and they are mad about working to a
plan1  Where the devil can I get a book of Tide Tables11

Whittaker brightened up1  1It1s a chance11 he said1  1Let1s go over
to the Admiralty11

We got into two of the waiting motor-cars--all but Sir Walter1
who went off to Scotland Yard--to 1mobilize MacGillivray11 so he said1
We marched through empty corridors and big bare chambers
where the charwomen were busy1 till we reached a little room lined
with books and maps1  A resident clerk was unearthed1 who
presently fetched from the library the Admiralty Tide Tables1  I sat
at the desk and the others stood round1 for somehow or other I had
got charge of this expedition1

It was no good1  There were hundreds of entries1 and so far as I
could see 10117 might cover fifty places1  We had to find some way
of narrowing the possibilities1

I took my head in my hands and thought1  There must be some
way of reading this riddle1  What did Scudder mean by steps1  I
thought of dock steps1 but if he had meant that I didn1t think he
would have mentioned the number1  It must be some place where
there were several staircases1 and one marked out from the others
by having thirty-nine steps1

Then I had a sudden thought1 and hunted up all the steamer
sailings1  There was no boat which left for the Continent at 10117 p1m1

Why was high tide so important1  If it was a harbour it must be
some little place where the tide mattered1 or else it was a heavy-
draught boat1  But there was no regular steamer sailing at that hour1
and somehow I didn1t think they would travel by a big boat from a
regular harbour1  So it must be some little harbour where the tide
was important1 or perhaps no harbour at all1

But if it was a little port I couldn1t see what the steps signified1
There were no sets of staircases on any harbour that I had ever
seen1  It must be some place which a particular staircase identified1
and where the tide was full at 101171  On the whole it seemed to me
that the place must be a bit of open coast1  But the staircases kept
puzzling me1

Then I went back to wider considerations1  Whereabouts would a
man be likely to leave for Germany1 a man in a hurry1 who wanted
a speedy and a secret passage1  Not from any of the big harbours1
And not from the Channel or the West Coast or Scotland1 for1
remember1 he was starting from London1  I measured the distance
on the map1 and tried to put myself in the enemy1s shoes1  I
should try for Ostend or Antwerp or Rotterdam1 and I should
sail from somewhere on the East Coast between Cromer and Dover1

All this was very loose guessing1 and I don1t pretend it was
ingenious or scientific1  I wasn1t any kind of Sherlock Holmes1  But I
have always fancied I had a kind of instinct about questions like
this1  I don1t know if I can explain myself1 but I used to use my
brains as far as they went1 and after they came to a blank wall I
guessed1 and I usually found my guesses pretty right1

So I set out all my conclusions on a bit of Admiralty paper1  They
ran like this1

               FAIRLY CERTAIN

     111  Place where there are several sets of stairs; one that
          matters distinguished by having thirty-nine steps1

     121  Full tide at 10117 p1m1  Leaving shore only possible at full
          tide1

     131  Steps not dock steps1 and so place probably not harbour1

     141  No regular night steamer at 101171  Means of transport must
          be tramp 1unlikely11 yacht1 or fishing-boat1

There my reasoning stopped1  I made another list1 which I headed
1Guessed11 but I was just as sure of the one as the other1

               GUESSED

     111  Place not harbour but open coast1

     121  Boat small--trawler1 yacht1 or launch1
     131  Place somewhere on East Coast between Cromer and Dover1

it struck me as odd that I should be sitting at that desk with a
Cabinet Minister1 a Field-Marshal1 two high Government officials1
and a French General watching me1 while from the scribble of a
dead man I was trying to drag a secret which meant life or death
for us1

Sir Walter had joined us1 and presently MacGillivray arrived1  He
had sent out instructions to watch the ports and railway stations for
the three men whom I had described to Sir Walter1  Not that he or
anybody else thought that that would do much good1

1Here1s the most I can make of it11 I said1  1We have got to find a
place where there are several staircases down to the beach1 one of
which has thirty-nine steps1  I think it1s a piece of open coast with
biggish cliffs1 somewhere between the Wash and the Channel1  Also
it1s a place where full tide is at 10117 tomorrow night11

Then an idea struck me1  1Is there no Inspector of Coastguards or
some fellow like that who knows the East Coast11

Whittaker said there was1 and that he lived in Clapham1  He went
off in a car to fetch him1 and the rest of us sat about the little room
and talked of anything that came into our heads1  I lit a pipe and
went over the whole thing again till my brain grew weary1

About one in the morning the coastguard man arrived1  He was a
fine old fellow1 with the look of a naval officer1 and was desperately
respectful to the company1  I left the War Minister to cross-examine
him1 for I felt he would think it cheek in me to talk1

1We want you to tell us the places you know on the East Coast
where there are cliffs1 and where several sets of steps run down to
the beach11

He thought for a bit1  1What kind of steps do you mean1 Sir1
There are plenty of places with roads cut down through the cliffs1
and most roads have a step or two in them1  Or do you mean
regular staircases--all steps1 so to speak11

Sir Arthur looked towards me1  1We mean regular staircases11 I said1

He reflected a minute or two1  1I don1t know that I can think of
any1  Wait a second1  There1s a place in Norfolk--Brattlesham--
beside a golf-course1 where there are a couple of staircases1 to let the
gentlemen get a lost ball11

1That1s not it11 I said1

1Then there are plenty of Marine Parades1 if that1s what you
mean1  Every seaside resort has them11

I shook my head1
1It1s got to be more retired than that11 I said1

1Well1 gentlemen1 I can1t think of anywhere else1  Of course1
there1s the Ruff--1

1What1s that11 I asked1

1The big chalk headland in Kent1 close to Bradgate1  It1s got a lot
of villas on the top1 and some of the houses have staircases down to
a private beach1  It1s a very high-toned sort of place1 and the residents
there like to keep by themselves11

I tore open the Tide Tables and found Bradgate1  High tide there
was at 10117 P1m1  on the 15th of June1

1We1re on the scent at last11 I cried excitedly1  1How can I find out
what is the tide at the Ruff11

1I can tell you that1 Sir11 said the coastguard man1  1I once was lent
a house there in this very month1 and I used to go out at night to
the deep-sea fishing1  The tide1s ten minutes before Bradgate11

I closed the book and looked round at the company1

1If one of those staircases has thirty-nine steps we have solved
the mystery1 gentlemen11 I said1  1I want the loan of your car1 Sir
Walter1 and a map of the roads1  If Mr MacGillivray will spare me
ten minutes1 I think we can prepare something for tomorrow11

It was ridiculous in me to take charge of the business like this1
but they didn1t seem to mind1 and after all I had been in the show
from the start1  Besides1 I was used to rough jobs1 and these eminent
gentlemen were too clever not to see it1  It was General Royer who
gave me my commission1  1I for one11 he said1 1am content to leave
the matter in Mr Hannay1s hands11

By half-past three I was tearing past the moonlit hedgerows of
Kent1 with MacGillivray1s best man on the seat beside me1


CHAPTER TEN
Various Parties Converging on the Sea


A pink and blue June morning found me at Bradgate looking from
the Griffin Hotel over a smooth sea to the lightship on the Cock
sands which seemed the size of a bell-buoy1  A couple of miles
farther south and much nearer the shore a small destroyer was
anchored1  Scaife1 MacGillivray1s man1 who had been in the Navy1
knew the boat1 and told me her name and her commander1s1 so I
sent off a wire to Sir Walter1

After breakfast Scaife got from a house-agent a key for the gates
of the staircases on the Ruff1  I walked with him along the sands1
and sat down in a nook of the cliffs while he investigated the half-
dozen of them1  I didn1t want to be seen1 but the place at this hour
was quite deserted1 and all the time I was on that beach I saw
nothing but the sea-gulls1

It took him more than an hour to do the job1 and when I saw
him coming towards me1 conning a bit of paper1 I can tell you my
heart was in my mouth1  Everything depended1 you see1 on my
guess proving right1

He read aloud the number of steps in the different stairs1  1Thirty-
four1 thirty-five1 thirty-nine1 forty-two1 forty-seven11 and 1twenty-
one1 where the cliffs grew lower1  I almost got up and shouted1

We hurried back to the town and sent a wire to MacGillivray1  I
wanted half a dozen men1 and I directed them to divide themselves
among different specified hotels1  Then Scaife set out to prospect
the house at the head of the thirty-nine steps1

He came back with news that both puzzled and reassured me1
The house was called Trafalgar Lodge1 and belonged to an old
gentleman called Appleton--a retired stockbroker1 the house-agent
said1  Mr Appleton was there a good deal in the summer time1 and
was in residence now--had been for the better part of a week1
Scaife could pick up very little information about him1 except that
he was a decent old fellow1 who paid his bills regularly1 and was
always good for a fiver for a local charity1  Then Scaife seemed to
have penetrated to the back door of the house1 pretending he was
an agent for sewing-machines1  Only three servants were kept1 a
cook1 a parlour-maid1 and a housemaid1 and they were just the sort
that you would find in a respectable middle-class household1  The
cook was not the gossiping kind1 and had pretty soon shut the door
in his face1 but Scaife said he was positive she knew nothing1  Next
door there was a new house building which would give good cover
for observation1 and the villa on the other side was to let1 and its
garden was rough and shrubby1

I borrowed Scaife1s telescope1 and before lunch went for a walk
along the Ruff1  I kept well behind the rows of villas1 and found a
good observation point on the edge of the golf-course1  There I had
a view of the line of turf along the cliff top1 with seats placed at
intervals1 and the little square plots1 railed in and planted with
bushes1 whence the staircases descended to the beach1  I saw Trafalgar
Lodge very plainly1 a red-brick villa with a veranda1 a tennis
lawn behind1 and in front the ordinary seaside flower-garden full of
marguerites and scraggy geraniums1  There was a flagstaff from
which an enormous Union Jack hung limply in the still air1

Presently I observed someone leave the house and saunter along
the cliff1  When I got my glasses on him I saw it was an old man1
wearing white flannel trousers1 a blue serge jacket1 and a straw hat1
He carried field-glasses and a newspaper1 and sat down on one of
the iron seats and began to read1  Sometimes he would lay down the
paper and turn his glasses on the sea1  He looked for a long time at
the destroyer1  I watched him for half an hour1 till he got up and
went back to the house for his luncheon1 when I returned to the
hotel for mine1

I wasn1t feeling very confident1  This decent common-place dwelling
was not what I had expected1  The man might be the bald
archaeologist of that horrible moorland farm1 or he might not1  He
was exactly the kind of satisfied old bird you will find in every
suburb and every holiday place1  If you wanted a type of the perfectly
harmless person you would probably pitch on that1

But after lunch1 as I sat in the hotel porch1 I perked up1 for I saw
the thing I had hoped for and had dreaded to miss1  A yacht came
up from the south and dropped anchor pretty well opposite the
Ruff1  She seemed about a hundred and fifty tons1 and I saw she
belonged to the Squadron from the white ensign1  So Scaife and I
went down to the harbour and hired a boatman for an afternoon1s fishing1

I spent a warm and peaceful afternoon1  We caught between us
about twenty pounds of cod and lythe1 and out in that dancing blue
sea I took a cheerier view of things1  Above the white cliffs of the
Ruff I saw the green and red of the villas1 and especially the great
flagstaff of Trafalgar Lodge1  About four o1clock1 when we had
fished enough1 I made the boatman row us round the yacht1 which
lay like a delicate white bird1 ready at a moment to flee1  Scaife said
she must be a fast boat for her build1 and that she was pretty
heavily engined1

Her name was the ARIADNE1 as I discovered from the cap of one of
the men who was polishing brasswork1  I spoke to him1 and got an
answer in the soft dialect of Essex1  Another hand that came along
passed me the time of day in an unmistakable English tongue1  Our
boatman had an argument with one of them about the weather1 and
for a few minutes we lay on our oars close to the starboard bow1

Then the men suddenly disregarded us and bent their heads to
their work as an officer came along the deck1  He was a pleasant1
clean-looking young fellow1 and he put a question to us about our
fishing in very good English1  But there could be no doubt about
him1  His close-cropped head and the cut of his collar and tie never
came out of England1

That did something to reassure me1 but as we rowed back to
Bradgate my obstinate doubts would not be dismissed1  The thing that
worried me was the reflection that my enemies knew that I had got my
knowledge from Scudder1 and it was Scudder who had given me the
clue to this place1  If they knew that Scudder had this clue1 would they
not be certain to change their plans1  Too much depended on their
success for them to take any risks1  The whole question was how much
they understood about Scudder1s knowledge1  I had talked confidently
last night about Germans always sticking to a scheme1 but if they had
any suspicions that I was on their track they would be fools not to
cover it1  I wondered if the man last night had seen that I recognized
him1  Somehow I did not think he had1 and to that I had clung1  But the
whole business had never seemed so difficult as that afternoon when
by all calculations I should have been rejoicing in assured success1

In the hotel I met the commander of the destroyer1 to whom
Scaife introduced me1 and with whom I had a few words1  Then I
thought I would put in an hour or two watching Trafalgar Lodge1

I found a place farther up the hill1 in the garden of an empty
house1  From there I had a full view of the court1 on which two
figures were having a game of tennis1  One was the old man1 whom
I had already seen; the other was a younger fellow1 wearing some
club colours in the scarf round his middle1  They played with tremendous
zest1 like two city gents who wanted hard exercise to open
their pores1  You couldn1t conceive a more innocent spectacle1  They
shouted and laughed and stopped for drinks1 when a maid brought
out two tankards on a salver1  I rubbed my eyes and asked myself if
I was not the most immortal fool on earth1  Mystery and darkness
had hung about the men who hunted me over the Scotch moor in
aeroplane and motor-car1 and notably about that infernal antiquarian1
It was easy enough to connect those folk with the knife
that pinned Scudder to the floor1 and with fell designs on the
world1s peace1  But here were two guileless citizens taking their
innocuous exercise1 and soon about to go indoors to a humdrum
dinner1 where they would talk of market prices and the last cricket
scores and the gossip of their native Surbiton1  I had been making a
net to catch vultures and falcons1 and lo and behold1 two plump
thrushes had blundered into it1

Presently a third figure arrived1 a young man on a bicycle1 with a
bag of golf-clubs slung on his back1  He strolled round to the tennis
lawn and was welcomed riotously by the players1  Evidently they
were chaffing him1 and their chaff sounded horribly English1  Then
the plump man1 mopping his brow with a silk handkerchief1 announced
that he must have a tub1  I heard his very words--1I1ve got into
a proper lather11 he said1  1This will bring down my weight and
my handicap1 Bob1  I1ll take you on tomorrow and give you a stroke a
hole11  You couldn1t find anything much more English than that1

They all went into the house1 and left me feeling a precious idiot1
I had been barking up the wrong tree this time1  These men might
be acting; but if they were1 where was their audience1  They didn1t
know I was sitting thirty yards off in a rhododendron1  It was simply
impossible to believe that these three hearty fellows were anything
but what they seemed--three ordinary1 game-playing1 suburban
Englishmen1 wearisome1 if you like1 but sordidly innocent1

And yet there were three of them; and one was old1 and one was
plump1 and one was lean and dark; and their house chimed in with
Scudder1s notes; and half a mile off was lying a steam yacht with at
least one German officer1  I thought of Karolides lying dead and all
Europe trembling on the edge of earthquake1 and the men I had
left behind me in London who were waiting anxiously for the
events of the next hours1  There was no doubt that hell was afoot
somewhere1  The Black Stone had won1 and if it survived this June
night would bank its winnings1

There seemed only one thing to do--go forward as if I had no
doubts1 and if I was going to make a fool of myself to do it
handsomely1  Never in my life have I faced a job with greater
disinclination1  I would rather in my then mind have walked into a
den of anarchists1 each with his Browning handy1 or faced a charging
lion with a popgun1 than enter that happy home of three
cheerful Englishmen and tell them that their game was up1  How
they would laugh at me1

But suddenly I remembered a thing I once heard in Rhodesia
from old Peter Pienaar1  I have quoted Peter already in this narrative1
He was the best scout I ever knew1 and before he had turned
respectable he had been pretty often on the windy side of the law1
when he had been wanted badly by the authorities1  Peter once
discussed with me the question of disguises1 and he had a theory
which struck me at the time1  He said1 barring absolute certainties
like fingerprints1 mere physical traits were very little use for
identification if the fugitive really knew his business1  He laughed at
things like dyed hair and false beards and such childish follies1  The
only thing that mattered was what Peter called 1atmosphere11

If a man could get into perfectly different surroundings from
those in which he had been first observed1 and--this is the important
part--really play up to these surroundings and behave as if
he had never been out of them1 he would puzzle the cleverest
detectives on earth1  And he used to tell a story of how he once
borrowed a black coat and went to church and shared the same
hymn-book with the man that was looking for him1  If that man had
seen him in decent company before he would have recognized him;
but he had only seen him snuffing the lights in a public-house with
a revolver1

The recollection of Peter1s talk gave me the first real comfort
that I had had that day1  Peter had been a wise old bird1 and these
fellows I was after were about the pick of the aviary1  What if they
were playing Peter1s game1  A fool tries to look different1 a clever
man looks the same and is different1

Again1 there was that other maxim of Peter1s which had helped
me when I had been a roadman1  1If you are playing a part1 you
will never keep it up unless you convince yourself that you are
it11  That would explain the game of tennis1  Those chaps didn1t
need to act1 they just turned a handle and passed into another
life1 which came as naturally to them as the first1  It sounds a
platitude1 but Peter used to say that it was the big secret of all
the famous criminals1

It was now getting on for eight o1clock1 and I went back and
saw Scaife to give him his instructions1  I arranged with him how to
place his men1 and then I went for a walk1 for I didn1t feel up to
any dinner1  I went round the deserted golf-course1 and then to a
point on the cliffs farther north beyond the line of the villas1

On the little trim newly-made roads I met people in flannels
coming back from tennis and the beach1 and a coastguard from the
wireless station1 and donkeys and pierrots padding homewards1
Out at sea in the blue dusk I saw lights appear on the ARIADNE and
on the destroyer away to the south1 and beyond the Cock sands the
bigger lights of steamers making for the Thames1  The whole scene
was so peaceful and ordinary that I got more dashed in spirits every
second1  It took all my resolution to stroll towards Trafalgar Lodge
about half-past nine1

On the way I got a piece of solid comfort from the sight of a
greyhound that was swinging along at a nursemaid1s heels1  He
reminded me of a dog I used to have in Rhodesia1 and of the time
when I took him hunting with me in the Pali hills1  We were after
rhebok1 the dun kind1 and I recollected how we had followed one
beast1 and both he and I had clean lost it1  A greyhound works by
sight1 and my eyes are good enough1 but that buck simply leaked
out of the landscape1  Afterwards I found out how it managed it1
Against the grey rock of the kopjes it showed no more than a crow
against a thundercloud1  It didn1t need to run away; all it had to do
was to stand still and melt into the background1

Suddenly as these memories chased across my brain I thought of
my present case and applied the moral1  The Black Stone didn1t need
to bolt1  They were quietly absorbed into the landscape1  I was on
the right track1 and I jammed that down in my mind and vowed
never to forget it1  The last word was with Peter Pienaar1

Scaife1s men would be posted now1 but there was no sign of a
soul1  The house stood as open as a market-place for anybody to
observe1  A three-foot railing separated it from the cliff road; the
windows on the ground-floor were all open1 and shaded lights and
the low sound of voices revealed where the occupants were finishing
dinner1  Everything was as public and above-board as a charity
bazaar1  Feeling the greatest fool on earth1 I opened the gate and
rang the bell1

A man of my sort1 who has travelled about the world in rough
places1 gets on perfectly well with two classes1 what you may call
the upper and the lower1  He understands them and they understand
him1  I was at home with herds and tramps and roadmen1 and I was
sufficiently at my ease with people like Sir Walter and the men I
had met the night before1  I can1t explain why1 but it is a fact1  But
what fellows like me don1t understand is the great comfortable1
satisfied middle-class world1 the folk that live in villas and suburbs1
He doesn1t know how they look at things1 he doesn1t understand
their conventions1 and he is as shy of them as of a black mamba1
When a trim parlour-maid opened the door1 I could hardly find my voice1

I asked for Mr Appleton1 and was ushered in1  My plan had been
to walk straight into the dining-room1 and by a sudden appearance
wake in the men that start of recognition which would confirm my
theory1  But when I found myself in that neat hall the place mastered
me1  There were the golf-clubs and tennis-rackets1 the straw hats
and caps1 the rows of gloves1 the sheaf of walking-sticks1 which
you will find in ten thousand British homes1  A stack of neatly
folded coats and waterproofs covered the top of an old oak chest;
there was a grandfather clock ticking; and some polished brass
warming-pans on the walls1 and a barometer1 and a print of Chiltern
winning the St Leger1  The place was as orthodox as an Anglican
church1  When the maid asked me for my name I gave it automatically1
and was shown into the smoking-room1 on the right side of the hall1

That room was even worse1  I hadn1t time to examine it1 but I
could see some framed group photographs above the mantelpiece1
and I could have sworn they were English public school or college1
I had only one glance1 for I managed to pull myself together and go
after the maid1  But I was too late1  She had already entered the
dining-room and given my name to her master1 and I had missed the
chance of seeing how the three took it1

When I walked into the room the old man at the head of the
table had risen and turned round to meet me1  He was in evening
dress--a short coat and black tie1 as was the other1 whom I called
in my own mind the plump one1  The third1 the dark fellow1 wore a
blue serge suit and a soft white collar1 and the colours of some club
or school1

The old man1s manner was perfect1  1Mr Hannay11 he said
hesitatingly1  1Did you wish to see me1  One moment1 you fellows1 and I1ll
rejoin you1  We had better go to the smoking-room11

Though I hadn1t an ounce of confidence in me1 I forced myself
to play the game1  I pulled up a chair and sat down on it1

1I think we have met before11 I said1 1and I guess you know
my business11

The light in the room was dim1 but so far as I could see their
faces1 they played the part of mystification very well1

1Maybe1 maybe11 said the old man1  1I haven1t a very good memory1
but I1m afraid you must tell me your errand1 Sir1 for I really don1t
know it11

1Well1 then11 I said1 and all the time I seemed to myself to be
talking pure foolishness--1I have come to tell you that the game1s
up1  I have a warrant for the arrest of you three gentlemen11

1Arrest11 said the old man1 and he looked really shocked1  1Arrest1
Good God1 what for11

1For the murder of Franklin Scudder in London on the 23rd day
of last month11

1I never heard the name before11 said the old man in a dazed voice1

One of the others spoke up1  1That was the Portland Place murder1
I read about it1  Good heavens1 you must be mad1 Sir1  Where do you
come from11

1Scotland Yard11 I said1

After that for a minute there was utter silence1  The old man was
staring at his plate and fumbling with a nut1 the very model of
innocent bewilderment1

Then the plump one spoke up1  He stammered a little1 like a man
picking his words1

1Don1t get flustered1 uncle11 he said1  1It is all a ridiculous mistake;
but these things happen sometimes1 and we can easily set it right1  It
won1t be hard to prove our innocence1  I can show that I was out of
the country on the 23rd of May1 and Bob was in a nursing home1
You were in London1 but you can explain what you were doing11

1Right1 Percy1  Of course that1s easy enough1  The 23rd1  That was
the day after Agatha1s wedding1  Let me see1  What was I doing1  I
came up in the morning from Woking1 and lunched at the club with
Charlie Symons1  Then--oh yes1 I dined with the Fishmongers1  I
remember1 for the punch didn1t agree with me1 and I was seedy next
morning1  Hang it all1 there1s the cigar-box I brought back from the
dinner11  He pointed to an object on the table1 and laughed nervously1

1I think1 Sir11 said the young man1 addressing me respectfully1
1you will see you are mistaken1  We want to assist the law like all
Englishmen1 and we don1t want Scotland Yard to be making fools
of themselves1  That1s so1 uncle11

1Certainly1 Bob11  The old fellow seemed to be recovering his
voice1  1Certainly1 we1ll do anything in our power to assist the
authorities1  But--but this is a bit too much1  I can1t get over it11

1How Nellie will chuckle11 said the plump man1  1She always said
that you would die of boredom because nothing ever happened to
you1  And now you1ve got it thick and strong11 and he began to
laugh very pleasantly1

1By Jove1 yes1  Just think of it1  What a story to tell at the club1
Really1 Mr Hannay1 I suppose I should be angry1 to show my
innocence1 but it1s too funny1  I almost forgive you the fright you
gave me1  You looked so glum1 I thought I might have been walking
in my sleep and killing people11

It couldn1t be acting1 it was too confoundedly genuine1  My heart
went into my boots1 and my first impulse was to apologize and
clear out1  But I told myself I must see it through1 even though I
was to be the laughing-stock of Britain1  The light from the dinner-
table candlesticks was not very good1 and to cover my confusion I
got up1 walked to the door and switched on the electric light1  The
sudden glare made them blink1 and I stood scanning the three faces1

Well1 I made nothing of it1  One was old and bald1 one was stout1
one was dark and thin1  There was nothing in their appearance to
prevent them being the three who had hunted me in Scotland1 but
there was nothing to identify them1  I simply can1t explain why I
who1 as a roadman1 had looked into two pairs of eyes1 and as Ned
Ainslie into another pair1 why I1 who have a good memory and
reasonable powers of observation1 could find no satisfaction1  They
seemed exactly what they professed to be1 and I could not have
sworn to one of them1

There in that pleasant dining-room1 with etchings on the walls1
and a picture of an old lady in a bib above the mantelpiece1 I could
see nothing to connect them with the moorland desperadoes1  There
was a silver cigarette-box beside me1 and I saw that it had been won
by Percival Appleton1 Esq11 of the St Bede1s Club1 in a golf tournament1
I had to keep a firm hold of Peter Pienaar to prevent myself
bolting out of that house1

1Well11 said the old man politely1 1are you reassured by your
scrutiny1 Sir11

I couldn1t find a word1

1I hope you1ll find it consistent with your duty to drop this
ridiculous business1  I make no complaint1 but you1ll see how annoying
it must be to respectable people11

I shook my head1

1O Lord11 said the young man1  1This is a bit too thick11

1Do you propose to march us off to the police station11 asked the
plump one1  1That might be the best way out of it1 but I suppose
you won1t be content with the local branch1  I have the right to ask
to see your warrant1 but I don1t wish to cast any aspersions upon
you1  You are only doing your duty1  But you1ll admit it1s horribly
awkward1  What do you propose to do11

There was nothing to do except to call in my men and have them
arrested1 or to confess my blunder and clear out1  I felt mesmerized by
the whole place1 by the air of obvious innocence--not innocence
merely1 but frank honest bewilderment and concern in the three faces1

1Oh1 Peter Pienaar11 I groaned inwardly1 and for a moment I was
very near damning myself for a fool and asking their pardon1

1Meantime I vote we have a game of bridge11 said the plump one1
1It will give Mr Hannay time to think over things1 and you know
we have been wanting a fourth player1  Do you play1 Sir11

I accepted as if it had been an ordinary invitation at the club1
The whole business had mesmerized me1  We went into the
smoking-room where a card-table was set out1 and I was offered
things to smoke and drink1  I took my place at the table in a kind of
dream1  The window was open and the moon was flooding the cliffs
and sea with a great tide of yellow light1  There was moonshine1
too1 in my head1  The three had recovered their composure1 and
were talking easily--just the kind of slangy talk you will hear in
any golf club-house1  I must have cut a rum figure1 sitting there
knitting my brows with my eyes wandering1

My partner was the young dark one1  I play a fair hand at bridge1
but I must have been rank bad that night1  They saw that they had
got me puzzled1 and that put them more than ever at their ease1  I
kept looking at their faces1 but they conveyed nothing to me1  It
was not that they looked different; they were different1  I clung
desperately to the words of Peter Pienaar1

Then something awoke me1

The old man laid down his hand to light a cigar1  He didn1t pick
it up at once1 but sat back for a moment in his chair1 with his
fingers tapping on his knees1

It was the movement I remembered when I had stood before him
in the moorland farm1 with the pistols of his servants behind me1

A little thing1 lasting only a second1 and the odds were a thousand
to one that I might have had my eyes on my cards at the time and
missed it1  But I didn1t1 and1 in a flash1 the air seemed to clear1  Some
shadow lifted from my brain1 and I was looking at the three men
with full and absolute recognition1

The clock on the mantelpiece struck ten o1clock1

The three faces seemed to change before my eyes and reveal their
secrets1  The young one was the murderer1  Now I saw cruelty and
ruthlessness1 where before I had only seen good-humour1  His knife1
I made certain1 had skewered Scudder to the floor1  His kind had
put the bullet in Karolides1

The plump man1s features seemed to dislimn1 and form again1 as
I looked at them1  He hadn1t a face1 only a hundred masks that he
could assume when he pleased1  That chap must have been a superb
actor1  Perhaps he had been Lord Alloa of the night before; perhaps
not; it didn1t matter1  I wondered if he was the fellow who had first
tracked Scudder1 and left his card on him1  Scudder had said he
lisped1 and I could imagine how the adoption of a lisp might add terror1

But the old man was the pick of the lot1  He was sheer brain1 icy1
cool1 calculating1 as ruthless as a steam hammer1  Now that my eyes
were opened I wondered where I had seen the benevolence1  His
jaw was like chilled steel1 and his eyes had the inhuman luminosity
of a bird1s1  I went on playing1 and every second a greater hate
welled up in my heart1  It almost choked me1 and I couldn1t answer
when my partner spoke1  Only a little longer could I endure
their company1

1Whew1  Bob1  Look at the time11 said the old man1  1You1d better
think about catching your train1  Bob1s got to go to town tonight11
he added1 turning to me1  The voice rang now as false as hell1
I looked at the clock1 and it was nearly half-past ten1

1I am afraid he must put off his journey11 I said1

1Oh1 damn11 said the young man1  1I thought you had dropped
that rot1  I1ve simply got to go1  You can have my address1 and I1ll
give any security you like11

1No11 I said1 1you must stay11

At that I think they must have realized that the game was desperate1
Their only chance had been to convince me that I was playing
the fool1 and that had failed1  But the old man spoke again1

1I1ll go bail for my nephew1  That ought to content you1 Mr
Hannay11  Was it fancy1 or did I detect some halt in the smoothness
of that voice1

There must have been1 for as I glanced at him1 his eyelids fell in
that hawk-like hood which fear had stamped on my memory1

I blew my whistle1

In an instant the lights were out1  A pair of strong arms gripped
me round the waist1 covering the pockets in which a man might be
expected to carry a pistol1

1SCHNELL1 FRANZ11 cried a voice1 1DAS BOOT1 DAS BOOT11  As it spoke I
saw two of my fellows emerge on the moonlit lawn1

The young dark man leapt for the window1 was through it1 and
over the low fence before a hand could touch him1  I grappled the
old chap1 and the room seemed to fill with figures1  I saw the plump
one collared1 but my eyes were all for the out-of-doors1 where
Franz sped on over the road towards the railed entrance to the
beach stairs1  One man followed him1 but he had no chance1  The
gate of the stairs locked behind the fugitive1 and I stood staring1
with my hands on the old boy1s throat1 for such a time as a man
might take to descend those steps to the sea1

Suddenly my prisoner broke from me and flung himself on the
wall1  There was a click as if a lever had been pulled1  Then came a
low rumbling far1 far below the ground1 and through the window I
saw a cloud of chalky dust pouring out of the shaft of the stairway1

Someone switched on the light1

The old man was looking at me with blazing eyes1

1He is safe11 he cried1  1You cannot follow in time 111  He is
gone 111  He has triumphed 111  DER SCHWARZE STEIN IST IN DER
SIEGESKRONE11

There was more in those eyes than any common triumph1  They
had been hooded like a bird of prey1 and now they flamed with a
hawk1s pride1  A white fanatic heat burned in them1 and I realized
for the first time the terrible thing I had been up against1  This man
was more than a spy; in his foul way he had been a patriot1

As the handcuffs clinked on his wrists I said my last word to him1

1I hope Franz will bear his triumph well1  I ought to tell you that
the ARIADNE for the last hour has been in our hands11


Three weeks later1 as all the world knows1 we went to war1  I joined
the New Army the first week1 and owing to my Matabele experience
got a captain1s commission straight off1  But I had done my best
service1 I think1 before I put on khaki1
